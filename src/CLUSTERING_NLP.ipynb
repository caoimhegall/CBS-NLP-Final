Just FYI). |(Review below from October 2014)|I wanted to savour every word in this novel. I alternately dragged out the reading experience to relish the language, and sped through sections because I felt greedy and impatient and wanted to see what linguistic marvels Alan Hollinghurst could produce next.|The story is centered round an upper-middle class family in London, whose son of the house, Toby, has a friend, Nick, stay over at the family\\u2019s posh Kensington home - a situation that lasts longer than any of them had expected and which has consequences for all. During this same period, Nick can no longer ignore his own homosexuality and begins a guilt-ridden yet thrilling exploration of it. As in The Swimming Pool Library and the Stranger\\u2019s Child, there isn\\u2019t (in my view) much plot in The Line of Beauty. It is largely composed of scenes and situations, a satire of rich people and politicians as experienced by the protagonist Nick Guest, who indeed feels like a guest in the privileged lives he witnesses but never quite belongs to. |The novel paints a picture of the 1980s and of Thatcher\\u2019s Britain as seen from the perspective of a young man, who can\\u2019t quite find his feet or a sense of purpose in life, and towards the end it also becomes a story about AIDS. That said, the story didn\\u2019t really get underway, or become interesting, to me until almost 300 pages into the book, exactly the opposite of The Stranger\\u2019s Child where I loved the first few hundred pages and then not so much the rest. |Hollinghurst has the uncanny ability to turn even base, human emotions into beautiful, lyrical prose which time and again made me stop and wonder at his incredible skill. But it isn\\u2019t just the words. It is also his insight into human psychology, his knowingness when it comes to human stupidity, triumphs and pretensions, his ability to observe and name every little tic, gesture and hidden meaning which conversations in society are so full of. (Where Zadie Smith captures the characteristics of some of the conversations belonging to London\\u2019s NW, Hollinghurst captures those of the privileged classes, and these parts were amazing \\u2013 a comedy of manners almost).|To me, this is some of the most beautiful English prose in contemporary English literature. And yet, at the same time, there isn\\u2019t a single character that I really invested in. Especially the main character felt rather anemic to me, pathetic even, in his strange insistence on politeness without integrity, which of course sets off the shallowness of some of the other characters but still had the effect that there was no one to root for. I\\u2019m still wondering what the intended effect was exactly. |Perhaps what I love most about his style is how it is the complete antithesis to the much-praised Scandinavian minimalism that I feel surrounded by (living in Denmark), and for that alone I applaud him. Hollinghurst is inspired by writers like Forster and James, whose works were written a hundred years ago or more, and even if I was not exactly bowled over by his story, there were times where I almost wanted to weep at the exquisiteness of his prose, his lines of beauty. (2-3 stars for the story, 5 stars for the language, leaving me a little above 3,5.

(Mother is dead.) Obeying his wishes is her heart's desire. In this she is a complete idiot, because her father is actually a terrible parent. Not only does Austin Ruthyn neglect her, but his will provides that on his death she will go live with his brother Silas, whom Maud has never met, until her majority. Putting the interests of one's child first would dictate that Maud go to live with her middle-aged cousin Monica, who has a lovely house, plenty of money, is fond of Maud, and actually does have her best interests at heart. But Austin is determined to have Maud live with Silas in order to rehabilitate Silas's reputation in the community: Silas was once accused of murdering a guest in his house, wrongly, Austin feels. If everyone sees that Austin has trusted Silas with the well-being of his child, they will stop believing Silas had anything to do with the man's death (which was, in fact, ruled a suicide). If Maud dies before Silas, he inherits the entire Ruthyn estate. What could possibly go wrong?|This novel had one of my now favorite new plot devices, the carriage ride that seemingly goes somewhere but actually goes nowhere. (It goes in an enormous circle, arriving back at its departure point, carriage inhabitants ignorant.) Supposedly Le Fanu got this plot device from something his great uncle Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the playwright, did once.|Someone should do a study of classic novels by male authors with first person female narrators in which the narrators opine about the characteristics of their gender. You get gems like this (Le Fanu via Maud): \\\"So Lady Knollys argued, with feminine energy, and I must confess, with a good deal of the repetition which I have sometimes observed in logicians of my own sex, and she puzzled without satisfying me.\\\" Translation: \\\"We ladies need to STFU, can I get an amen?\\\"|Then there was this 8-comma sentence, probably surpassed only by The New Yorker at some point....|\\\"I remember how, when, after we had got, late at night, into bed, I sat up, shivering with horror, in mine, while honest Mary's tranquil breathing told how soundly she slept.\\\" I know!

            "Book: 1984\n",
            "Summary: Like it, Yay. These are the successes of 1984 's paranoia, far outliving its original intent as a battery against where Communism was going (Orwell was a severely disappointed Marxist), and while people who compare their leaders to Big Brother are usually overreaching themselves and speak far away from Orwell's intent and vision, it is a useful catchcloth for dissent. I almost don't know what to think about this book.\n",
            "--------------------\n",
            "Book: Animal Farm\n",
            "Summary: 3. Animal Farm is the story of a set of animals who overthrow their human-owner. A huge applause to Orwell for being able to explain human psyche, political and social dilemma wrapped in the form of this story. It is an outstanding novel, with the hallmarks of a true classic; it is both entertaining and profound.\n",
            "--------------------\n",
            "Book: Cataract\n",
            "Summary: Unfortunately that's where my enjoyment of the book ended. Obviously I wasn't expecting entertainment when I read Osadchy's account of his arrest and imprisonment, like those attending Bruce's act were, but Caynnyk's obsessive compiling of footnotes, designed to highlight the injustice of the sentence and to further illustrate the scope of the KGB crackdown on Ukrainian intelligentsia in the mid-sixties, takes Osadchy's memoir and turns it into a kind of plea for worldwide condemnation of the authorities responsible. solzhenitsyn and shalamov and yermakov are unequalled storytellers, and odoevskaya and sinyavsky and chukovskaya and grossmann all wrote perfect novels (not just them, either: dovlatov shat out at least 6 of the fuckers). Old problems have morphed into new problems, with more layers of complexity--or at least different layers. The list goes on...……. There is something about translator Marco Caynnyk's presentation of Mykhaylo Osadchy's Cataract that reminds me of this scene in Lenny .\n",
            "--------------------\n",
            "Book: Crime and Punishment\n",
            "Summary: I went into it like a wise man, and that was just my destruction. I have read some incredible books since, Hunger (my love of which stems from the similarities to Dostoevsky I noticed in the book), Gravity’s Rainbow , or To the Lighthouse to name a few, yet nothing has ever left as deep of an impact on me as a reader and as a human being as this book. It is Raskolnikov’s personal, internal struggle with the evil he has perpetrated. He lets a drunkard, the comical character of Marmeladov, who pushes his wife to insanity and his daughter to prostitution, revel in the pleasure of suffering, sounding almost like a philosopher when he cherishes his idea that god will honour the self-sacrifice of the women he has destroyed, and that the same god will indiscriminately have mercy on himself as well, for being so willing to suffer (especially the pulling of hair does a great deal of good, according to Marmeladov, comical effect included!). Crime and Punishment features an immensely engaging blend of intrigue; philosophy; political, social, moral and religious commentary, that all thread together to create a masterpiece of literature that captures the deep, raw core of the human condition when it is at it’s most gruesome and vulnerable.\n",
            "--------------------\n",
            "Book: Flaubert's Parrot\n",
            "Summary: The beginning is confusing. Ironically enough, for a book that, at least in part, is about telling the life story of someone we are reputedly assured did not really want to be known for his life, but rather have his novels literally out live him, this book tells you, naturally enough, much more about Flaubert than about his novels. You might think this is a book about Flaubert's parrot. All in all a very fine novel, written in a clever, efficient style. The fictitious narrator Doctor Geoffrey Braithwaite scrutinizes the correspondence between Flaubert and his net of acquaintances and a sample of pompous academic miscellania to (mis-)construct his own theories about the writer’s life, or rather, he presents the evidence and allows the reader to make his own assumptions in quite a burlesque style.\n",
            "--------------------\n",
            "Book: Infinite Jest\n",
            "Summary: But this book has become a part of me, has articulated experiences and feelings that I've had in a way that is almost painfully beautiful, and challenges my way of thinking not only while reading but afterwards. In short: Jest my brains out.\n",
            "--------------------\n",
            "Book: Jane Eyre\n",
            "Summary: She is a rebel - setting out to have her own career in a male-dominated world, refusing to let a man rule her life (that applies to both Rochester and St. John here), and making statements that may have not had the most sympathetic audience back in her day: \" Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, to absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. (Oh naive young me, putting way too much stock in Rochester's woes after his first marriage , sleeping with everyone in Europe and rejecting them probably because they were not English enough for him!) 3. There is nothing left to the imagination and the explicit way emotions and feelings are portrayed is remarkable, sentimental but also appropriate. There is such a rawness to the writing, although some would say overly dramatic but for me it is another beautiful and remarkable aspect to this book, because it works. Jane is not in love with a pretty façade of Rochester - since he has none (a thing that contemporary writers should learn, by the way - writing love that stems from something else that simple attraction to physical beauty).\n",
            "--------------------\n",
            "Book: The Afternoon of a Writer\n",
            "Summary: This book looks to get around that by spending such a small sliver of time with our author, our storyteller, but in effect, our author and storyteller exists primarily in his own head (as he himself observes, over and over) so in the end it's a futile gesture, but a beautiful one, more about the solipsism of a writer and how the written word can never truly capture that quotidian moment. And insight.\n",
            "--------------------\n",
            "Book: The History of the Siege of Lisbon\n",
            "Summary: What does love have to do with this? And one word can change history. I found I needed to understand more about Portuguese history to fully appreciate the storyline, so it took me a while to finish this book, since I was constantly looking up events and people that played a role in the actual Siege of Lisbon. In short, this book requires a great deal of patience and concentration. We also know that history is written mostly by the victors. He's NOT MY KIND OF WRITER: he asks way too much of his readers, & one wonders what would happen if Saramago had SOMETHING going on, namely a STORY, & if he added all the flourishes that make him unique: THAT would truly grab me.\n",
            "--------------------\n",
            "Book: To Kill a Mockingbird\n",
            "Summary: BONUS QUOTE: This is Scout talking to Atticus after getting to know someone she had previously be afraid of: “ ‘When they finally saw him, why he hadn’t done any of those things . If you are someone who loves books, you might have already read this book. . However, in a story of so much evil and injustice there is also hope, bravery, and kindness. As a reader you are never allowed to feel with Tom Robinson, the Black man who is innocently convicted for raping a white woman, because all the Black characters in this tale are sidelined.\n",
