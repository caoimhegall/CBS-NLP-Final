Just FYI). |(Review below from October 2014)|I wanted to savour every word in this novel. I alternately dragged out the reading experience to relish the language, and sped through sections because I felt greedy and impatient and wanted to see what linguistic marvels Alan Hollinghurst could produce next.|The story is centered round an upper-middle class family in London, whose son of the house, Toby, has a friend, Nick, stay over at the family\\u2019s posh Kensington home - a situation that lasts longer than any of them had expected and which has consequences for all. During this same period, Nick can no longer ignore his own homosexuality and begins a guilt-ridden yet thrilling exploration of it. As in The Swimming Pool Library and the Stranger\\u2019s Child, there isn\\u2019t (in my view) much plot in The Line of Beauty. It is largely composed of scenes and situations, a satire of rich people and politicians as experienced by the protagonist Nick Guest, who indeed feels like a guest in the privileged lives he witnesses but never quite belongs to. |The novel paints a picture of the 1980s and of Thatcher\\u2019s Britain as seen from the perspective of a young man, who can\\u2019t quite find his feet or a sense of purpose in life, and towards the end it also becomes a story about AIDS. That said, the story didn\\u2019t really get underway, or become interesting, to me until almost 300 pages into the book, exactly the opposite of The Stranger\\u2019s Child where I loved the first few hundred pages and then not so much the rest. |Hollinghurst has the uncanny ability to turn even base, human emotions into beautiful, lyrical prose which time and again made me stop and wonder at his incredible skill. But it isn\\u2019t just the words. It is also his insight into human psychology, his knowingness when it comes to human stupidity, triumphs and pretensions, his ability to observe and name every little tic, gesture and hidden meaning which conversations in society are so full of. (Where Zadie Smith captures the characteristics of some of the conversations belonging to London\\u2019s NW, Hollinghurst captures those of the privileged classes, and these parts were amazing \\u2013 a comedy of manners almost).|To me, this is some of the most beautiful English prose in contemporary English literature. And yet, at the same time, there isn\\u2019t a single character that I really invested in. Especially the main character felt rather anemic to me, pathetic even, in his strange insistence on politeness without integrity, which of course sets off the shallowness of some of the other characters but still had the effect that there was no one to root for. I\\u2019m still wondering what the intended effect was exactly. |Perhaps what I love most about his style is how it is the complete antithesis to the much-praised Scandinavian minimalism that I feel surrounded by (living in Denmark), and for that alone I applaud him. Hollinghurst is inspired by writers like Forster and James, whose works were written a hundred years ago or more, and even if I was not exactly bowled over by his story, there were times where I almost wanted to weep at the exquisiteness of his prose, his lines of beauty. (2-3 stars for the story, 5 stars for the language, leaving me a little above 3,5.

(Mother is dead.) Obeying his wishes is her heart's desire. In this she is a complete idiot, because her father is actually a terrible parent. Not only does Austin Ruthyn neglect her, but his will provides that on his death she will go live with his brother Silas, whom Maud has never met, until her majority. Putting the interests of one's child first would dictate that Maud go to live with her middle-aged cousin Monica, who has a lovely house, plenty of money, is fond of Maud, and actually does have her best interests at heart. But Austin is determined to have Maud live with Silas in order to rehabilitate Silas's reputation in the community: Silas was once accused of murdering a guest in his house, wrongly, Austin feels. If everyone sees that Austin has trusted Silas with the well-being of his child, they will stop believing Silas had anything to do with the man's death (which was, in fact, ruled a suicide). If Maud dies before Silas, he inherits the entire Ruthyn estate. What could possibly go wrong?|This novel had one of my now favorite new plot devices, the carriage ride that seemingly goes somewhere but actually goes nowhere. (It goes in an enormous circle, arriving back at its departure point, carriage inhabitants ignorant.) Supposedly Le Fanu got this plot device from something his great uncle Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the playwright, did once.|Someone should do a study of classic novels by male authors with first person female narrators in which the narrators opine about the characteristics of their gender. You get gems like this (Le Fanu via Maud): \\\"So Lady Knollys argued, with feminine energy, and I must confess, with a good deal of the repetition which I have sometimes observed in logicians of my own sex, and she puzzled without satisfying me.\\\" Translation: \\\"We ladies need to STFU, can I get an amen?\\\"|Then there was this 8-comma sentence, probably surpassed only by The New Yorker at some point....|\\\"I remember how, when, after we had got, late at night, into bed, I sat up, shivering with horror, in mine, while honest Mary's tranquil breathing told how soundly she slept.\\\" I know!

Just FYI). |(Review below from October 2014)|I wanted to savour every word in this novel. I alternately dragged out the reading experience to relish the language, and sped through sections because I felt greedy and impatient and wanted to see what linguistic marvels Alan Hollinghurst could produce next.|The story is centered round an upper-middle class family in London, whose son of the house, Toby, has a friend, Nick, stay over at the family\\u2019s posh Kensington home - a situation that lasts longer than any of them had expected and which has consequences for all. During this same period, Nick can no longer ignore his own homosexuality and begins a guilt-ridden yet thrilling exploration of it. As in The Swimming Pool Library and the Stranger\\u2019s Child, there isn\\u2019t (in my view) much plot in The Line of Beauty. It is largely composed of scenes and situations, a satire of rich people and politicians as experienced by the protagonist Nick Guest, who indeed feels like a guest in the privileged lives he witnesses but never quite belongs to. |The novel paints a picture of the 1980s and of Thatcher\\u2019s Britain as seen from the perspective of a young man, who can\\u2019t quite find his feet or a sense of purpose in life, and towards the end it also becomes a story about AIDS. That said, the story didn\\u2019t really get underway, or become interesting, to me until almost 300 pages into the book, exactly the opposite of The Stranger\\u2019s Child where I loved the first few hundred pages and then not so much the rest. |Hollinghurst has the uncanny ability to turn even base, human emotions into beautiful, lyrical prose which time and again made me stop and wonder at his incredible skill. But it isn\\u2019t just the words. It is also his insight into human psychology, his knowingness when it comes to human stupidity, triumphs and pretensions, his ability to observe and name every little tic, gesture and hidden meaning which conversations in society are so full of. (Where Zadie Smith captures the characteristics of some of the conversations belonging to London\\u2019s NW, Hollinghurst captures those of the privileged classes, and these parts were amazing \\u2013 a comedy of manners almost).|To me, this is some of the most beautiful English prose in contemporary English literature. And yet, at the same time, there isn\\u2019t a single character that I really invested in. Especially the main character felt rather anemic to me, pathetic even, in his strange insistence on politeness without integrity, which of course sets off the shallowness of some of the other characters but still had the effect that there was no one to root for. I\\u2019m still wondering what the intended effect was exactly. |Perhaps what I love most about his style is how it is the complete antithesis to the much-praised Scandinavian minimalism that I feel surrounded by (living in Denmark), and for that alone I applaud him. Hollinghurst is inspired by writers like Forster and James, whose works were written a hundred years ago or more, and even if I was not exactly bowled over by his story, there were times where I almost wanted to weep at the exquisiteness of his prose, his lines of beauty. (2-3 stars for the story, 5 stars for the language, leaving me a little above 3,5.

(Mother is dead.) Obeying his wishes is her heart's desire. In this she is a complete idiot, because her father is actually a terrible parent. Not only does Austin Ruthyn neglect her, but his will provides that on his death she will go live with his brother Silas, whom Maud has never met, until her majority. Putting the interests of one's child first would dictate that Maud go to live with her middle-aged cousin Monica, who has a lovely house, plenty of money, is fond of Maud, and actually does have her best interests at heart. But Austin is determined to have Maud live with Silas in order to rehabilitate Silas's reputation in the community: Silas was once accused of murdering a guest in his house, wrongly, Austin feels. If everyone sees that Austin has trusted Silas with the well-being of his child, they will stop believing Silas had anything to do with the man's death (which was, in fact, ruled a suicide). If Maud dies before Silas, he inherits the entire Ruthyn estate. What could possibly go wrong?|This novel had one of my now favorite new plot devices, the carriage ride that seemingly goes somewhere but actually goes nowhere. (It goes in an enormous circle, arriving back at its departure point, carriage inhabitants ignorant.) Supposedly Le Fanu got this plot device from something his great uncle Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the playwright, did once.|Someone should do a study of classic novels by male authors with first person female narrators in which the narrators opine about the characteristics of their gender. You get gems like this (Le Fanu via Maud): \\\"So Lady Knollys argued, with feminine energy, and I must confess, with a good deal of the repetition which I have sometimes observed in logicians of my own sex, and she puzzled without satisfying me.\\\" Translation: \\\"We ladies need to STFU, can I get an amen?\\\"|Then there was this 8-comma sentence, probably surpassed only by The New Yorker at some point....|\\\"I remember how, when, after we had got, late at night, into bed, I sat up, shivering with horror, in mine, while honest Mary's tranquil breathing told how soundly she slept.\\\" I know!

It is fast-paced, sweet-tempered, open-hearted, a golden book in many ways \\u2013 a paean to youth, to a future brimming with possibility, to a present that is lived vibrantly and joyfully. It is also about selling out, junkies, prostitution, and race wars. How can this be? I suppose it is all about point of view, and the protagonist\\u2019s perspective is the embodiment of Live Now and Love It. This is one of those rare novels that make the reader feel even more alive by reading it. The enthusiasm of its narrator was equaled by my enthusiasm of the world that MacInnes plunges us into headfirst. It depicts, it mocks, it leaps forward, it grabs your hand and carries you along.|I was young once, gosh, just a decade or so ago. I lived a life full of punks, hippies, goths, ravers, djs, fags, dykes, trans girls & guys, straight guys who made out with other guys and straight girls who were angry and ardent feminists, vegetarians and vegans, girls who stripped for cash in dives and guys who waved their hard-ons for free in print, fighters and peacemakers, guys who carved symbols on their bodies and girls who dressed like vampire princesses; we lived in junked-out flats filled with too many people, we shared clothes and went on road trips and had neverending parties and made protests against the government and danced all night and consumed amazing amounts of booze and drugs and sex and live music. I read Absolute Beginners during that period, and one of the best things about this novel was that it felt completely real and true to me, despite the difference in social scenes that were separated by decades, by an ocean. It showed the true diversity available to people in their late teens, in their 20s; it illustrated \\u2013 and so nonchalantly \\u2013 values that were not just held dear, but were unspoken, values that defied the middle class and that were simply assumed to be shared by everyone we knew. To read oneself and one\\u2019s peers in a novel written in 1958 is something special, something wonderfully moving to contemplate, even many years later.|What lifts Absolute Beginners above the idea that life for the young and unencumbered can be a great time, a fun carnival, is its complete awareness that this is also rather an illusion, and a crushingly temporary one at that. So many wonderful things can happen, so much excitement \\u2013 and yet the world around this world still exists to be fought against. For me and my friends, that world to rail against did not just include asshole yuppies who came to our neighborhoods from time to time, it included police brutality, the WTO, the wars abroad. In Absolute Beginners, that world above includes race warfare. \\\"Race\\\" is clearly interwoven throughout the narrative, and yet it is one of so many things that the narrator is aware of, just one facet of the world that the narrator comments on... the reader could almost lose sight of it. But race and racism are there the entire time and slowly but surely become the whole point; by the end, the reader and the protagonist see how fragile a life full of living can be when the world is singling out his peers for destruction, and those peers are turning to him for alliance. The protagonist chooses, and chooses well. But it marks an ending of sorts, an ending of an attitude and a lifestyle, and the beginning of an understanding that no matter what he and his peers have built, he lives in the world still, as does everyone, and that world is one of both wonder and horror. One of the reasons I picked up |Absolute Beginners| again was because of historian Dominic Sandbrook's daft grudge against Colin Macinnes (in |\\n|Never Had It So Good|\\n|). I last attempted it in my teens. It had been a slowish read \\u2013 proved to be the same this time round \\u2013 and was easy to give up on back then because the library copy was a horrible mouldy one. |Now, the vintage atmosphere and detail in the story was way more interesting so I hung around to savour that (when younger I'd filed this era as being 'before anything was cool'), noticing differences from the film musical, and processing the late 1950s slang. Plenty of 60s slang is still immediately familiar yet this stuff from only 5-10 years earlier, not immortalised in pop culture, can require a moment's thought to work out. These characters are the cool kids of my parents' generation, yet they are so different it reminded me how facile the idea of generation=social attitude can be. (One of the good points Sandbrook makes is that most people of this era, even the younger ones, weren't mods, hippies or their rock 'n' roll precursors, they were hardworking squares.) |There's something artificial about the way the main character loves the term \\u201cteenager\\u201d (as beloved of the media then as \\u201chipster\\u201d has been for the last few years, though back then there was more fear and real disapproval, rather than the contemporary eye-rolling). He likes defining what it means to be a teenager \\u2013 it's a culture at least as much as an age, squares aren't really teenagers \\u2013 and it's not that different from The Who's 'My Generation', by the time of whose release the narrator and his mates might (if they weren't still pop-culture purveyors) be boring oldsters. The over-consciousness of cultural definitions works in a way because he's one of those entrepreneurial kids who's interested in talking to the media and getting noticed by the movers and shakers (in an 80s or 90s setting he'd be a DJ / party planner, here he's a photographer, proto-|Blow-Up|) but it's also a reminder that |Absolute Beginners| was written by a champagne socialist easily old enough to be the protagonist's dad. Some of the press evidently loved it (a quote on the back from |Harpers & Queen| says \\\"Prose as sharp as a pair of Italian slacks and vivid as a pair of pink socks\\\", |The Sunday Times|: \\\"The cult novel of the year.\\\"). But I'd love to know what the real teenagers of the day thought of this book... Was everything in it so five years ago by the time they ever saw a copy? (By the 80s, presumably re-reviewing in the light of the film, the |NME| says \\\"Macinnes caught it first - and best\\\"; and Paul Weller, just born when it was published, \\\"a book of inspiration.\\\")|Some reviewers are critical of the way black, Jewish or gay people are described by the narrator. There's an element of positive stereotyping, complimentary or neutral description with frequent reference to some of the narrator's friends' background (how lively a friend's Jewish household is compared with his English one, there are white girls who fancy black men apparently because of sexual stereotypes, that sort of thing). But they have personalities too, and the narrator is way more inclusive and accepting than most of his contemporaries, even prepared to get injured defending his mates during the Notting Hill race riots. His way of speaking is what, over decades, evolved into the contemporary attitudes that mean it isn't okay to say the same things now. Such critics tend to dislike arguments for historical context, but if ever there was a good one for those people cutting a text some slack, it's with this book. |I'm kind of surprised to see so many reviews on here, and quite good ones, for |Absolute Beginners|; I'd had the impression its reputation was fading. Seems that inclusion in |1001 Books To Read Before You Die| has boosted it a bit. For my part I'd recommend it mostly for people interested in the social & cultural history, and for those who like some background to their vintage clothes/film/music habit.  A rather entertaining novel which evokes the emerging youth culture in Great Britain in the 1950s. An unnamed 18-year-old story teller searches for his own way in life, but obviously wrestles with the classic social conventions. The last quarter the book is more a description of the growing minority problem, including racial riots. The city of London shines through the book, and the author clearly shows his love for that city. Of course, this radiates the atmosphere of the times it was published (1959), with quite a few pages full of slang, but at the same time it has something refreshing. A plus also is the engaging style of MacInnis, with some razor-edge dialogues. Fun! Controversial. Interesting!|And you get to have the Bowie song in your head the entire time.

A good read and did well to portray the time and place but not the classic I was expecting. Definitely worth a read though. To be honest, this book was more interesting to me for its historical value than for anything contained in the story. Absolute Beginners' narrator felt like something of a dull archetype \\u2013 the arrogant late-teenager convinced he knows more than those around him, and unaware of his own failings. | Perhaps it was more of a novelty in 1958, when it was written. Which brings me to what I thought was most intriguing about the novel. To me at least, it read for all the world like the anachronistic work of someone writing in much more recent times about how they would have imagined the late 1950s to be. The passing references to running like Dr Roger Bannister or driving away from a riot like Fangio could so easily have been clumsy attempts to remind the reader that the story is taking place in a particular historical setting. But more than that, the anti-racist politics of the latter part of the novel, set against the background of the 1958 Notting Hill race riots, read to me like a modern liberal's wish fulfilment of what a white liberal kid in the late 50s might have made of it (though such an author would probably have refrained from having his narrator use the term 'Spade' to describe the black characters. MacInnes was, in this respect at least ahead of his time. Perhaps the more remarkable for the fact that he was already about the same age as the narrator's father and maybe this goes some way to explain another of the book's oddities \\u2013 the narrator's idiolect and use of slang terms I've never really encountered anywhere else. Not being old enough to judge myself, I might be doing MacInnes a disservice, but I couldn't help thinking of Anthony Burgess' made up youth argot from A Clockwork Orange. An moderately interesting diversion, which I'd picked up after hearing Andy Miller praising it on Little Atoms, but nothing more. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this. It's the first book of the year and the first book I had to read for this semester of university (for my post-1945 literature class) and it definitely sets the tone for a good year of reading.|It was way funnier than I expected and I really enjoyed the episodic element of the story. We basically follow the main character who is a young photograph in 1958's London through 4 different days in 4 different months of the year. The main character's narrative voice is very unique and it reminded me a lot of Alex from the Clockwork Orange in the sense that both characters invent their own slang and language through which they see and describe their world. The book is divided in four parts and every part is focused on one day. Even though at first the story seems to be a simple romance, it progressively gets more and more complicated as the author is getting closer to the events of the Notting Hill race riots in September of 1958. There is a strong element of diversity in the characters, we have black people, Indians, homosexuals, lesbians and more. MacInnes really strives to inform the reader of his time and bring to him a new understanding of the culture of these minorities, different from the way they were represented in the media.  A long summer in the London of the late fifties is the setting, as the nameless eighteen year old protagonist makes his living taking pornographic photographs in the few gaps in his hectic social life spent on his Vespa and in the coffee bars and jazz clubs. As the months pass he experiences friendship, betrayal, love and death with a motley cast of friends known by their nicknames, jobs or fashion sense; the deranged Wizard, the rentboy the Fabulous Hoplite, Mr Cool, the Misery Kid, Crepe Suzette and Ed the Ted. |There is the semblance of a plot, but this is driven by its protagonist, in whose character the reader is soon engrossed by, a teenager full of innocence looking at injustices around him, and deciding to act; particularly with regard to race, and the riots of the time. |Its about growing up, becoming wiser and yet remaining young and fearless, looking sharper and staying one step ahead of the crowd.|The book is rich in social history, with some wonderful descriptions of the city and the jazz of the day. As the 60s approach its the birth of the Mod scene, and quite inspirational.  I always had a soft spot for Julien Temple's film |Absolute Beginners|. I guess it was a bit overly ambitious to make a modern musical based on a 1958 novella, but I am grateful for the attempt. It produced a beautiful soundtrack featuring songs from Smiley Culture and the Style Council; wonderful vignettes from David Bowie (tap-dancing across a giant typewriter), Ray Davies, and Sade; and an opening sequence of black and white photographs from 1950s London which are nostalgic and heartbreaking to watch. And where did he get that great opening shot of Piccadilly Circus?!|I guess that's the real attraction of the book. It's an ode to a city that the narrator loves so much, it nearly breaks his heart. Colin MacInnes is keenly aware that he is writing about a time that is already in the past, that is already gone, that he already feels the ache of loss for. Basho might sum it up as \\\"Sitting in London, I miss London.\\\" The city as we imagine it isn't the reality and maybe that's what it means to be a teenager: that process of discovering that how you think the world should be isn't what it actually is. With that lesson, this is a coming-of-age novel in the spirit of Catcher in the Rye -- the love of place and childhood innocence that inevitably slips away.|The movie, for a musical, did capture a lot more in the book than I would have expected, but it certainly borrowed most heavily from the first and last chapters: meeting all of the narrator's Soho characters and the 1958 riots: setting and plot, and some rather slick dialogue. But being a musical, the movie is a bit shallow in character. The novel gives us two middle chapters which the movie largely ignores, but gives readers an insight into the inner thoughts and feelings of the narrator. The relationship of the narrator to his family and his father in particular is deeply touching. Despite the narrator's apathetic attitude to anything of seriousness and his dismissive attitude toward old-timers, past and present catches up with him.|This book has a special place in my heart and always will. I adore meeting all the characters in the narrator's life, and 1958 London certainly looks wild and fun, but the author's injection of pathos gives this cult novel an authenticity that makes it universal. (Although, I still feel I need a hip chat dictionary.) |Bonus takeaway: Hipsters seem even more derivative after this novel. On the plus side I could still remember whole scenes from this work although it has been at least twenty years since I last read it. The negative is that it hasn't aged well. It rings as true as a lead pound coin. The author's attempt to approximate working class and youth cultural speech is cringe worthy and patronising. The reality was that McInnes was from a middle-class background and grew up in pre-war colonial Australia long before the concept of the teenager as an entity existed. He vacillates between regurgitating media reports about the teenage phenomenon and preaching liberal-left propaganda. The cast of stereotypical characters are moved around a cardboard cut-out set reminiscent of an Edwardian child's toy theatre. As Colin points out to his older brother,|\\u2018In those days, it seems, you were just an overgrown boy, or an under-grown man, life didn\\u2019t seem to cater anything whatever else between.\\u2019|His generation, however, were not just following their parents or becoming father or mother clones. They were the first adolescent group to have money, their own clothes, and the first adolescent group to consider themselves \\u2018teenagers\\u2019. They were starting out from scratch, making it up as the went along. They weren\\u2019t just beginners in the world of adults. They were absolute beginners.| I am sure that the plot is that great or the ending that satisfying, but the whole thing is so vibrant that it just carried me along. I loved it.  Back in 1999 I watched a film called Quadrophenia, in which depicts the life of a mod: The clothes he buys, the music he listens to, the love for Vespas and the constant showdowns with rockers. I thought it was quite original ( I knew it was based of a rock opera) Now that I have read Absolute beginners I am certain that this book was clearly an influence.|The plot is about the life of a mod. It also focuses on the lifestyle. However, it is much more than that. For starters there are a lot of passages about the freedom that youth brings and how older generations do not understand them. The main character is a jazz loving 19 year old, just ready to enter his twenties and we get his views on how society looks in his eyes, the absolute beginners being the name he calls his generation. I guess one could call this book an early YA novel.|Absolute Beginners is a love letter to London: but not only the romantic aspect. Like Last Exit to Brooklyn, Macinnes mentions people who usually do not feature in books. Thus we get portrayals of drug addicts, black communities and the London gay scene. The final section on the book is a loose commentary on the immigrants which entered London during that time.|Did I like the book? Although I found it interesting, I didn\\u2019t gel with the narration style plus I did find it overlong, the first section could have easily been shorter. I do know that the book has an ardent following and is somewhat a cult classic. Lately I've been into mid-century books narrated by teenagers. While I was traveling in London a couple of weeks ago, I started reading |Absolute Beginners| about 1958 Notting Hill in the run-up to the race riots. Now I'm reading Jos\\u00e9 Agust\\u00edn's |La Tumba|, which was published in 1964 and follows a rebellious, literary teenager as he attempts to navigate the stiff, adult world of 1960s Mexico City. |I realized why I'm finding these books appealing when I watched the |recent documentary on JD Salinger|, author of perhaps the most famous midcentury book narrated by a teenager, |The Catcher in the Rye|. All teenagers feel alienated from adult society \\u2014 mostly because they refuse to succumb to the phoniness of it all. In order to become successful in life, you must accept a level of phoniness. You must learn to refrain from expressing certain opinions. You must master the art of sycophancy and tactical deference. Adult social interaction is, |in the words of Irving Goffman|, \\\"theatrical performance.\\\" |But teenagers aren't yet invested enough in their careers or communities to succumb to the phoniness. And so, refreshingly, they rebel against it. Teenage protagonists of novels are so appealing because, despite their insecurity and inexperience, they are authentic. They allow us to engage in the fantasy of doing and saying what we merely think because we're afraid of upset the theatrical performance of polite society.|Throughout my week in London, I became increasingly attached to the nameless, teenage narrator. |Absolute Beginners| is the British equivalent of beatnik literature. But instead of depicting the jeans-and-t-shirt-wearing literary beats of the US, we're entreated to a ragtag cast of |mods| and |teddy boys|, the two rival youth subcultures of post-war London. The novel depicts youth culture in London through the eyes of a precocious, empathetic teenager in the run-up to the |1958 Notting Hill race riots|. |The book is great social documentary of London's complicated multicultural coming of age through the eyes of a narrator's personal coming of age. It's also excellent fiction with a Kerouac-like unorthodoxy of prose. If you're interested in learning more about the 1958 race riots, BBC as a good |overview|, and |Stasy Adams| and |Nick Bentley| have written academic pieces on MacInnes's portrayal of 1950s London in his fiction. \\u201cNow, you can think what you like about the art of jazz \\u2013 quite frankly, I don\\u2019t really care what you think, because jazz is a thing so wonderful that if anybody doesn\\u2019t rave about it, all you can feel for them is pity: not that I\\u2019m making out I really understand it all \\u2013 I mean, certain LPs leave me speechless.\\u201d |\\u2015 Absolute Beginners|Colin MacInnes' novel \\\"Absolute Beginners\\\" (1959) is a wide-lens view of pre-Beatlemania London, with characters, images and ideas that remain pop fixtures: stylish, jazz-loving Mods; leather-clad, rock-loving Teddy Boys; the ascendancy of the teenager with increased income and diminished responsibility; and an atmosphere of combustible youth culture reacting to WWII-era morals.|\\\"Absolute Beginners\\\" is a remarkable period artifact for those reasons alone, but its literary qualities will surprise many readers looking for the cult novel that profoundly influenced Paul Weller. MacInnes' novel is energetic, lyrical and often brilliantly written. With its combination of cynical, stylized observation and dreamlike panoramas, \\\"Absolute Beginners\\\" feels like J.D. Salinger's \\\"Catcher in the Rye\\\" crossed with C\\u00e9line's \\\"Journey to the End of the Night\\\" and \\\"Death on the Installment Plan.\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0|The novel is less a plotted tale than a shifting, mildly surreal journey across London and its outskirts. Divided into four chapters, each section captures the events of a single day over separate months in 1958. The unnamed 18-year old narrator creates the impression of a \\\"Lord of the Flies\\\" social experiment in reverse, where teenagers have created a separate, superior civilization of freedom and literate sophistication. Living independently as a photographer in a diverse West End neighborhood, he encounters a range of colorful characters: the \\\"ponce\\\" (pimp) Wiz, the biracial Mr. Cool, the lesbian Big Jill, the violent and illiterate Ed the Ted, and his unrequited love \\\"Cr\\u00eape\\\" Suzette. The key conflicts are the threat of a race riot, the narrator's complex love for Suzette, whom he finds in a mariage blanc with an older man, and the sad expectation that youth's fleeting, ecstatic moment will soon fade.|With its unremitting imagery and stylized wordplay, \\\"Absolute Beginners\\\" is probably best read in a short immersive burst where its unique atmosphere can be savored before its novelty fades. Readers willing to surrender to its rhythms will discover an oblique, charged reality, a dreamily evocative Swinging London of the mind. Julien Temple's 1986 musical film adaptation, more \\\"Newsies\\\" than C\\u00e9line, suggests the challenges of filming MacInnes' vision. The participation of David Bowie and Ray Davies confirms its lasting influence, but it remains a unique, unrepeatable artifact. I had to take some time to organise my thoughts on this. It's difficult to assess exactly what I think of a book that is so firmly set in and attached to a particular time and place. A further problem is that the time is a couple of decades before I was born and the place is the opposite side of the country. As a result, I have no idea if the events or the narration of |Absolute Beginners| are in any way authentic. I also don't really care. The narration really reminded me of Anthony Burgess's |A Clockwork Orange|, not only because both books are narrated by disaffected youths but because there's also a similar rhythm and feel to it.|I found the first half of the book less interesting than the last. While I enjoyed bouncing around the London mod scene, particularly the nicknames and commentary on the other characters, I never felt very invested in the narrator's on/off relationship with Suze and really didn't feel that there was much tension in it. The sections I enjoyed the most were the home visits with his family and the race riots that conclude the story. I felt that his conversations with his mother and father really showed the generational disconnect without being overly dramatic or cliched. Both the family and race riot sections are when the prose comes out of the setting and moves onto more universal themes. |The race riot deserves its own special paragraph. This is the part of the book that I felt was truly great. The simmering tension that we feel before things start to get violent conjured up images from Spike Lee's masterful |Do the Right Thing|. Again we see themes and issues raised that are as relevant today as they've ever been. In particular, the way that racial tensions are exploited by tabloid media. Although the media featured here is print, today's TV news is every bit as bad and the tabloids are still what they've always been. The government and police are also criticised for their ineffectiveness, either through a lack of will or a lack of ability. The more things change... It\\u2019s London in 1958, and the narrator of Colin MacInnes\\u2019s novel is living in what seems to be a new-minted teenage paradise, where teens, for the first time, have money to spend and the freedom to spend. It\\u2019s a world where all races, creeds and levels of society mix, a world where the (never named) narrator feels totally at home \\u2014 the only cloud on the horizon being that the love of his love, Suze, has agreed to marry her homosexual boss as a front (homosexuality being illegal at the time). The narrator spends most of the first half of the book wandering round London, talking to Teddy boys, pimps, TV personalities, pop stars, jazz cats, fellow teens and advertising executives \\u2014 they all seem to know him, and many owe him a favour or two. Everything\\u2019s looking up.|But, no, it isn\\u2019t. 1958 was the year of some infamous race riots, and MacInnes\\u2019s narrator lives right in the middle of where they\\u2019re brewing. Also, his dad may be dying.|It\\u2019s a novel that seeks to capture the brave new world of its time, when life for its young narrator seems full of nothing but possibility, only to be suddenly dashed as he becomes thoroughly disgusted with the intolerance, violence, and sheer complacency his fellow human beings are capable of. It\\u2019s written in a rather odd style \\u2014 I\\u2019m not sure if teenagers actually spoke in this peculiar mix of mock-formality and jazz-like improvisation (it reminded me most of all of Anthony Burgess\\u2019s invented patois for |A Clockwork Orange|). Here\\u2019s a sample:|\\u2018Hail, squire,\\u2019 I said. \\u2018Long time no see. How is you are we? Won\\u2019t you say tell?\\u2019|Moments of insight, moments of poetry, moments of confusion. A slice of life shot through with bursts of teenage outrage and human compassion. Nice and short, too. I started reading this novel with bad intentions. I wanted to laugh at it. For some reason I assumed it was going to be corny, poorly written and absurdly naive... As it happens, it |does| contain some language that has dated in such a way that it brings a smile to the lips of the modern reader, but it's simply not possible to read this book right through with an ironic smirk. It's just too good, too exuberant, too smart, too accomplished, and the issues it raises are acutely appropriate for our own age.|The single quality about it that impressed me the most is the relative sophistication of the narrator in the essential political, cultural and social aspects of London life. Bear in mind that this is the 1950s. The narrator's attitudes are more advanced than those of the average person that I remember in my childhood back in the 1970s; and his style is a damn sight sharper. This book has changed my view of what life was like in '50s Britain. It wasn't |necessarily| all grey and bland... I wanted to read Absolute Beginners because of its ties to the development of Mod culture. I was expecting to get a glimpse into late 1950s British youth culture, but the book explores a whole lot more than that. I found the first 10 pages or so a little hard going until I got my head around the rhythm of the speech patterns, but once I was used to it and sorted out a few of the slang words it made for easy reading. |The first person narration really gives you a really personal look into the life of a main character with a very distinctive voice in quite a unique time culturally. At the same time MacInnes deftly weaves the bigger social issues of race, class, and sexual orientation into this very personal story, not unlike the way Christopher Isherwood captured 1930s Germany in his Berlin Novels.|Absolute Beginner's is not only a fascinating look into 1950s British youth culture, but British culture as whole just before the dawn of the far more documented 1960s. An interesting, thought provoking, witty novel set in London in 1958 and written in the first person from the perspective of an eighteen year old white teenage boy. He is a free lance photographer living in an apartment block. He is very social, mixing with a variety of individuals. He describes the smoky jazz clubs of Soho, the coffee bars of Notting Hill, his relationships with his girlfriend Suzette, his mother, father, siblings and friends.|I found the last fifty pages of the novel particularly interesting as he vividly describes the beginnings of the Notting Hill racial disturbances / riots from the perspective of a white teenager.|A worthwhile, rewarding reading experience. This book was first published in 1959. From BBC Radio 4 - Book at Bedtime:|Colin MacInnes's cult classic about teenagers, style and racial tension in 1950s London A lively story and thought-provoking at times. The copious slang reminded me of A Clockwork Orange. I rate it a four-minus.  This is the second book I read for the books1001 LiveJournal book club community. It was not one I would have picked up to read on my own, and probably wouldn't otherwise have finished even if I did start reading it. The reason is that I found the language difficult to follow, being full of slang and dialect that I am unfamiliar with. Also, after the first hundred pages or so, I realized that nothing was really going to happen. This book is more a portrait of a lifestyle, or of a generation, than a plotty story. Yes, there are some story arcs and character development, but they do not really generate a sense of tension or movement in the book. |Having said that, I was deeply impressed by the author's style of writing, by his use of vocabulary and image-building. I felt that I was there, in London of the 1950s, and was completely infected by the malaise, helplessness, yet hopefulness of the main character and his acquaintances. |======|And here is the more extensive review I posted on books1001:|Title: Absolute Beginners|Author: Colin MacInnes|Publication date: First published 1959, this edition re-issued 1986 by Penguin Books|# of pages: 226|Source: Bought used through Amazon.de (3 Euros + 3 Euros shipping)|Summary/Back of the book: It was the fag-end of a London summer in the fifties and change simmered below the surface... The young and the restless -- the Absolute Beginners -- were busy creating a new world of cool music, coffee bars and freer love, as different from Mrs Dale and traditional England's green and pleasant land as they dared to make it. Sharp, pungent, filled with the dreams and danger of city life, Absolute Beginners is now a brilliant film.|My review: The Great Gatsby, meet After Hours (1985 Scorsese film). Briefly: This is a book I wouldn't have picked up on my own, but I feel enriched after having read it.|There's not much plot: An 18-year-old Londoner who makes a living taking pornographic photographs wanders around the city, meeting up with various movers, shakers, pimps, prostitutes, and representatives of pretty much every disadvantaged and advantaged minority of his acquaintance. There are Jews, blacks, and Sikhs, lesbians and gays, white supremacists, gang bangers, television personalities, newspapermen and -women, socialites, songwriters, a diplomat, half-siblings, dysfunctional family members, an advertising executive, and lots and lots of jazz aficionados. And of course the requisite love interest, who is unhappily married to a gay man old enough to be her father.|The book consists mainly of the protagonist (who is never named) bouncing from one encounter to the next, partly driven by his need to hustle up some business and partly through sheer chance and the fact that he seems to know everyone who's anyone, and most of the people who aren't as well. The only loose plot threads that I could pick out were our boy's puppy-love pursuit of Suzette, and the slowly building racial conflict that explodes in the last section. I don't want to make it seem like the book is about race or class conflict, though; at least it didn't come across that way to me. It was more (again, to me at least) about the disconnection and rootlessness of the post-war generation.|There is so much that could be analyzed in this book, but I'll just touch on one point which I think illustrates this underlying theme. That is the lack of names for the characters. Not only the narrator, but many of his acquaintances are only referred to by various nicknames such as The Wizard, Call-me-Cobber, the ex-Deb, and Mr Cool. It is as if the narrator has rejected the names (and thus the roles) assigned to them by their parents, as representatives of the previous generation, and they are re-inventing themselves, or seeking their own identities and by doing so, re-defining the world itself.|Moving on to the other main point I wanted to discuss, I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with the style in which this book was written. This is the love part:|\\\"Up out in Pimlico, the old, old city raised her bashed grey head again, like she was ashamed of her modern daughter down by the river, and I went up the streets of dark purple and vomit green, all set at angles like ham sandwiches...\\\"|The imagery is pure poetry, and never degrades into cliche. I was mesmerized by the descriptions, and surprised time and again by the new and imaginative ways in which the author put words together to create an emotional impression.|But this is the hate part: |'And why, Ed,' I said, 'have you moved darn ear?'|'Cos me Ma as,' he said. 'She's bin re-owsed.'| |I find reading dialect tiresome, and especially as an American, it's difficult to figure out.|or:|And straining up the Portobello road, I passed a crocodile of infants, and among them a number of little Spadelets, and I noticed, not for the first time, how, in the underground movement of the juveniles, they hadn't been educated up yet to the colour thing.|This is an example of the pervasiveness of slang expressions; it took me a long time to eventually realize that 'Spades' are blacks. I still don't know what is meant here by 'a crocodile of infants'. This lack of understanding the vocabulary really interfered with the flow of the narrative for me.|(Side note: This book was made into a movie in 1986, which was a commercial flop. I would have liked to order the DVD as well, but I wasn't sure if it would play on my DVD player. Also, according to the Wiki entry, the story was changed quite a bit for the movie. You may have heard the David Bowie song of the same title, written as the theme song for this movie. It hit #2 on the U.K. charts.)|If you're looking for action-packed adventure or a heartfelt love story that will make you weep, this isn't the place to find it. But if you're looking for top-notch writing, deep thoughts packaged in entertaining and engaging characters, and a portrait of a generation that is both timeless and inextricably bound up in its setting, you should get a copy of this book and set aside an afternoon (it's a fairly quick read) to read it. I loved this book for its energy, its youthfulness, its optimism and its realism. Reading it made me feel like a teenager again - populated as it is with young people who were England's first ever teenagers (and doing far more with their youth than I ever did with mine). The distrust of adults and the scepticism of their austere rules creates a bubble in which young people move, with a freedom adults resent. |And of course, it just goes to show that the same arguments come round again and again. The Notting Hill race riots of 1958 were one more example of scapegoating minorities, and the narrator (author) is a refreshingly liberal voice from the era in the same way young people today are more accepting of difference and change. The unnamed narrator may use pejorative terms like 'Spade' and 'Poof', but he likes black people and gay people, and he sees no reason why what makes them different to the white straight majority should stop everyone getting along.|It's also an unromantic love letter to London. |So many great passages from the book that if I started quoting I'd never stop. I understand Absolute Beginners is one of three books by MacInnes themed on London and black culture in the 50s, and I'll get around to reading the other two some day. |(Despite being a massive Bowie fan I've never seen the film, but from what I know of it I can see how hard it must have been to capture the book's implicit wonder at being alive in any film starring Patsy Kensit.)|(Oh! But the theme song from the film is great.) After I got a little bit into this book, with its outdated slang and its theme of youth rebellion and after glancing at the copyright page -- it first came out in 1959 -- I realized, \\\"Ah, this is the British response to 'On the Road.'\\\" England is a smaller country, of course, so instead of tooling across the North American continent in search of wigged out jazz musicians and so on, the characters are taking cabs between Soho and Notting Hill to listen to some skiffle in a pub. And instead of Dean Moriarty's metaphysical yearning for a lost father, the main character stops in to visit his dad at his flat in Pimlico. Fair enough; there are still the junkies and queers. But even so, I started to notice something wrong: the slang, even given the trans-Atlantic differences, seemed a bit tone-deaf, and the characters spent too much time actually TALKING about the generation gap and \\\"teenagers\\\" instead of just showing what the generation was about. Then I noticed that MacInnes was born in 1914. What? Someone who was born before the Great War is trying to write a definitive novel about what it's like to be a teenager on the eve of the 1960s? It must have seemed revolutionary at the time, but now that people have their social history sorted out a little better, this novel doesn't quite work, even though Anthony Burgess actually called it one of the 100 must-reads of the 20th century, or something like that. Second in a trilogy. I'll give the other two a pass. Hugely enjoyable and a reminder that teenagers were not a construct of the 1960s. This is London in '58 - a mass of kids with attitude and cash, throwing off the shackles of post-war austerity and indulging in drink, drugs, casual sex and jazz. Everything that the oldsters hold dear is rejected, everything is new and fresh and has to have a new cool name (\\\"Fabulous Hoplite\\\" and the \\\"Ex-Deb-of-Last-Year\\\"). Our narrator is a teenage photographer out for kicks, a proper Londoner who can barely bring himself to move out of his manor and nothing gets him more than the friction between the indiginous brainless youth (The Teds) and the coloured immigrant labour (constantly and I'm afraid probably authentically called \\\"spades\\\"). Everything is in ferment - black against white, old against young, big ideas in the smallness of their world. A bible of late fifties cool. I love this book. I read it at that special time when I was a teenager as with Catcher in the Rye when these two novels meant the world to me because I could identify with the main characters. I am certain that if I first read them as an adult I would not hold these two books so dear. Nostalgia is a great thing.|I think Absolute Beginners suffered in popularity because of the 1986 film, as I recall they left out my favourite character The Great Hopite and I didn't care for all the Jazz hand/pointy toed pirouette dancey bits that were not in the book. It was definitely a cool trendy book to read before the film and now no one talks about it much which is a shame because it is a great book. Mysteriously out of print for many years, this classic novel of teenage life in fifties and sixties London charts the late and largely unlamented cafe bar culture of the period, full of sharp suits and casual violence. Despite being slightly dated, in particular due to its outdated terminology, the book evokes the period in expert fashion. It is chiefly memorable for its depiction of early immigration into Britain from Africa and the Caribbean. Made into a by all accounts lamentable film featuring Patsy Kensit.\",\n          \"If I had to describe this book in one sentence - little stories that magically contain big and excitingly complex ideas. |Writers aren't evaluated in the context of history as stringently as artists are. There are artists alive now who can paint with the technical bravura of the likes of Tintoretto or Titian but no one, understandably, is interested in their work. I suppose this conundrum was most famously demonstrated by the Dutch forger Van Meegeren who resented the fact that the art world showed no interest in his dated derivative work and so forged Vermeer paintings as if it's technical skill alone that distinguishes genius. Recently I read some of the books by William Trevor and you could say he too, like Van Meegeren was a forger. He appropriated the distinctive style of past masters - and yet, as if the past had never happened, he receives the acclaim no painter doing the same thing would get. What I'm getting at is that if you put Akutagawa in the context of history it's remarkable how innovative and pioneering these stories are, especially considering many were written before Calvino was even born (the writer Akutagawa most reminds me of some ways) and before Katherine Mansfield was being credited for evolving the possibilities of the short story. (How I wish she had read him!) Put him in the context of history and Akutagawa is a marvel. Not that he isn't a marvel whatever way you look at him.| Stand outs are his unreliable narrators in Rashomon where eye witnesses to a mysterious death all give conflicting accounts of what happened. Dragon: The Old Potter's Tale where a ridiculed monk with a big nose as revenge posts a notice declaring the dragon of the lake will ascend to heaven on the third day of the third month. Much to his amazement a massive crowd gathers on that day. Here, as DeLillo would be years later, Akutagawa is fascinated by the pull and power of the crowd. Red Onions where a young girl living from hand to mouth in a bedsit goes out on her first date and is suitably lit up by romantic expectation but discovers the highlight of the evening are the cheap red onions she stumbles upon (Akutagawa doesn't hold romantic aspiration in high esteem!) And finally the last autobiographical story where the narrator is plagued by a concatenation of disarming synchronicities which gives you an idea why Akutagawa was to kill himself soon after. |Brilliantly fresh and compelling from start to finish.  It is probably not very rare when an extremely gifted person emerges on this planet. But it is rare when this person manages to absorb the influences of many cultures and produce a very original innovative syntheses in his short life. The whole body of work that transcends the national boundaries and would influence a way of writing for decades and even centuries. I know only three names in the 20th century Kafka, Borges and now, Akutagawa. Notably he was the first. What unites all these three, they were born either into the culture without long established national literary tradition or in the time of dramatic changes of the society and literature. I would leave Kafka aside. But both Borges and Akutagawa were immersed in many different languages and cultures since their childhood. Borges has read even Don Quixote in English. Akutagawa was reading both Japanese and Chinese traditional literature as child but also hungrily absorbed almost 200 years of the Western literature by the age of 18.|My first encounter with Akutagawa was unsuccessful. While at university, I\\u2019ve picked up his collection of short stories and found them too stylised and boring. Now many years after, my view has changed almost to the opposite extreme. I can read him many times and never get bored. In fact, I absolutely admire the versatility of his gift. His variety of styles is exceptionally wide. And he was always experimenting with his method and searching for new techniques through his short life. He never was totally satisfied it seems. He changed the decorations and styles. But there is one thing which always present in his tales. It is authenticity of human feelings. It is also amazing how many writers he anticipated, including Kafka and Borges but even Knausgaard though it might sound incredible to start with. |I\\u2019ve read much bigger volume of his stories in Russian. Not that big part of his work has been translated into English. But I think this collection contains many of his best tales with a few notable exceptions. I would just pause on a few to underscore the versatility of his gift:|\\u201cRashomon\\u201d and \\u201cIn a Bamboo grove\\u201d. Those two are the most famous as they were the base of the movie by Kurosawa. But purely from the perspective of the literature, the second one stands out. Apparently it is the first time ever when a bunch of unreliable narrators are describing the same story from the different perspective, contradicting each other. And the single \\u201ctruth\\u201d is never revealed. Robert Browning apparently did something similar in |The Ring and the Book| but Akutagawa raised it to the totally different level with the open ending. Now we are so much get used to this tool. But even from the perspective of our century, this is the one of the most elegant and economically told stories of this type.|\\u201cHell Screen\\u201d - this is not a medieval tale. This is a philosophic investigation about the dominance of the high art over reality. Apparently Akutagawa visited an anatomy morgue to write this story.|\\u201cThe story of head fell off\\u201d - it is included here in a comical section, but there is nothing comical about this story. And the image of a deep blue sky getting closer and closer would stay with me for a long time.|\\u201cGreen onions\\u201d - this story I would not be surprised to find between early Chekhov tales. How our high expectations from life often end with the prose of the aforementioned vegetable.|\\u201cHorse legs\\u201d - purely from the land of Kafka.|There are a few of the notable omissions in this collection:|\\u201cThe Yam Gruel\\u201d is translated into English. It is included into |Rashomon and Other Stories|. It is a tale about the feeling of a \\u201clittle\\u201d person modelled on Gogol\\u2019s Overcoat. As far as I remember, Gogol\\u2019s character dies from the shock of loosing the overcoat. But Akutagawa has twisted the tale asking very different question: what if he would get what he dreams about? And there is no Akaki Akakievich. He has been replaced by a samurai.|\\u201cHandkerchief\\u201d - It is available in English as well. It is included into |Mandarins: Stories by Ry\\u016bnosuke Akutagawa|. The collection of the recently translated stories by Archipelago press. What a clever short story this is! On the surface it is about East-West and its mutual accommodation. But this is not a simple story. It is one of those tales like a matreshka doll. You\\u2019ve opened one not expecting to find another, but it is in there. And then - one more. And the smallest one does not look anything like the initial one and leaves you puzzled what was the story about really.|Now the section called \\u201cAkutagawa own story\\u201d. While reading the introduction in my Russian collection, I\\u2019ve learned a lot about the state of the Japanese literature at the time. Due to the Meji reformation and opening to the West, they tried to build up their modern literature by absorbing around 200 years of the Western Canon. Obviously they were loosing themselves in the process. Apparently they did not have a concept of a novel per se. So in 1885 Tsubouchi Sh\\u014dy\\u014d (1859-1935) a literary critic, translator of Western literature, and novelist formulated the principle for the Japanese fiction in his work\\u00a0Sh\\u014dsetsu Shinzui\\u00a0(The Essence of the Novel). He came to the conclusion that the descriptive realism should be the way to go. This has apparently helped to focus the minds of the Japanese writers. |Many of them has taken the idea even a step further following the theory that only object a person could know truthfully is her/himself. As a result they developed something called |\\\"I-novel\\\" (\\u79c1\\u5c0f\\u8aac, Shish\\u014dsetsu, Watakushi Sh\\u014dsetsu)| where a writer would describe both his mental and physical life in its daily details with the varied level of psychological depth. So the fashionable 21th century auto-fiction was in fact born in Japan about a century earlier. I was amazed to find that out. But why i am talking about it? Akutagawa initially considered it more or less as lazy and limiting exercise. But then, at some stage, in his last decade he has started to experiment with the method. At the same time he kept experimenting with the style, used huge range of framing devices from the letters to the dialogues and the sketchs of unwritten novels (the device later successfully used by Borges who loved Akutagawa's work). He also kept his psychological complexity in these stories. And his very last tales before his suicide are read more like impressionistic pieces full of terrible beauty rather than the confessional tales. |One serious omission form this part of this collection is \\u201cDialogue in darkness\\u201d, the story that is written as a conversation between Akutagawa and the angel or maybe he is the fallen angel who has become a devil. I\\u2019ve searched whether the story exists in English. But did not find anything conclusive. The story was published posthumously. And I wanted to finish with the quote from there:|D. You will very likely die soon.|Akutagawa: But that thing which has created me at the first place will create the second me.|And the \\u201csecond him\\u201d is the powerful and omnipresent influence in the world literature since. \\u201cIn fulfillment of his longstanding dream, he became the author of several books. But what he got in return was a desolate loneliness.\\u201d| |This collection offers a piercing insight into the stunning yet troubled mind of Ry\\u016bnosuke Akutagawa. A writer brought to the world by a madwoman, he was a well-known insomniac, a drug addict, a guilt-plagued sinner, yet he produced such beautiful works while hounded by the looming shadows of his inevitable insanity. |This masterwork can be adequately divided into three parts: the first part (A World in Decay & Under the Sword) are vivid myth-like stories set during the Heian, Kamakura, and other pre-war eras of Japan. From the titular story of an encounter under the Rash\\u014dmon (a gate built as a monument in the southern entrance of Kyoto) to the story of a painter who perfectly depicted the fury of hell into a screen, the first few stories present such beautiful and breath-taking pictures of early Japan in all its splendor with its unique culture and oriental beliefs in full display. |The second part (Modern Tragicomedy) are surrealistic stories set during Akutagawa\\u2019s lifetime towards the dusk of the Meija era and the early smoldering of the Taisho. These haunting yet humorous stories reflect the slowly decaying psyche of Akutagawa as his fears and nerves start to take hold of his pen. |And the last part (Akutagawa\\u2019s Own Story) are his final manuscripts towards the end of his life when all he could muster to craft were words formed by his horrors and his painful loneliness. In one of its few bright spots he writes, |\\u201cIn my savage joy, I felt as if I had no parents, no wife, no children, just the life that flowed forth from my pen.\\u201d| But these last few remnants of thought from this gifted storyteller evoke mostly the sorrowful darkness of a mind in despair whose only solace was literature. The different eras of Japan were his canvas, his brushstrokes his blood, wrung out unbearably, drop by drop, till he had none more to bleed.|\\u201cI don\\u2019t have the strength to keep writing this. To go on living with this feeling is painful beyond description. Isn\\u2019t there someone kind enough to strangle me in my sleep?\\u201d| |What initially was a beautiful and elegant collection morphed into an outpouring of literary agony towards the end. In this regard it is like a Chimera, a two-fold beast, formed by the fictional beauty of Akutagawa\\u2019s tales and the painful terrors of his grotesque reality. One night, I woke in the dark hours no longer able to sleep. After a while I accepted my semi-wakeful state and found my way to the sofa. There I settled under a blanket and flicked ideally through the TV channels, eventually I happened upon a film |Ghost Dog|, not apparently to be confused with |Moondog| | although to my mind ghost dogs and moondogs must be much of a muchness, no? |, anyway the film seemed to be pleasing pretentious and about right for being neither asleep nor awake but watching moving pictures on a screen. Two of the stories in this collection were made in to a film, but the powers of the night which decide our sleeping have so far not decreed that I must see that film in the early hours of a star lit morning so I haven't.|As it happened the film made mention of the story collection | Rashomon| which seemed to be of some importance to the title character and his philosophical stance and so when it came to pass that I was gripped, not by midnight wakefulness but by mid-afternoon book madness, I ordered it from the library and in time it came to me from Gravesend, so if you are in Gravesend it will be a couple of days before it is back with you - patience!|Akutagawa chronologically is approximately a contemporary of Katherine Mansfield, he also died young and was much concerned in his fiction with death and psychology, but unlike her at least based on the stories I've read, he has a broader range of story settings and is somewhat less interested in gender and romantic relationships. In this volume the stories range from the title story set in medieval Japan to the recent past to his own days in inter-war Japan. Both Mansfield and Akutagawa were fellow travellers in their modernism, attempting to capture the fleeting contact of human awareness of the moment and the fractured, unreliable perception of an individual.|Really these are stories one could read repeatedly and I recommend them warmly, despite the grimness of the autobiographical ones which twist around fears of madness and thoughts of suicide | which ultimately led to the end of the author's own life|.|Yes, Modernism, madness and death - everybody's favourites, I am plainly really going out of my way to encourage you to try these. So what can I say that is a bit more tempting? Dare I mention the wide range of styles, the sometimes uneasy mixture of the Japanese and the European? Akutagawa was a big fan of Dostoevsky and the fin de Siecle writers, indeed one story here may be a Japanesed version of Grushenka's Story of an Onion from |The Brothers Karamazov|, then again it could be, I suppose, a Buddhist folktale. There's also a lot of humour, in different registers, in one story a man in Manchuria suddenly finds he has horse's legs and we find that eventually nature is stronger than nurture, in another a waitress struggling to get by on romantic dreams and a low wage, might be about to be seduced by a man when she spots spring onions on sale at a bargain price. |So great variety and a glimpse into the troubled soul of another person, quite a lot in just over two hundred pages of extremely short short-stories. And there's more... an introduction by Haruki Murikami assesses Akutagawa in the context of a Japanese writer attempting to find his own voice while drawing upon both Japanese and European literary heritages; 'I love Dostoevsky and Strindberg and Flaubert and I am a discipline of Natsume Soseki'. Murikami holds that Akutagawa's literary dead end in trying to marry the traditions in himself led to his physically premature dead-end, in which case the introduction is a kind of meta-fiction and we can read all eighteen stories in the collection as nestled within it the multiple attempts of a prisoner to escape their unique cell. He tries historical settings, Chinese settings, contemporary settings, he draws on his life experience, his personal history as a adopted child is reflected in his divided literary heritage, so we are treated to a fireworks display of creativity, it has to stop of course, as all fireworks' displays must, but it is spectacular while it lasts.|The perfect example of Murikami's point is the story | On a Bamboo Grove| which places the reader in the position of an examining magistrate of early medieval Japan - we read a collection of testimonies relating to the discovery of a dead body in said bamboo grove. Are any of them true? Even taking the testimonies together and mentally reconstructing events is that the truth of what happens? Is there an objective truth beyond that a man who was once alive is now dead? For practical reasons in daily life in order to have a functioning legal system we pretend that this is so, but as a writer appealing to readers Akutagawa makes a different point, the same one maybe as he makes throughout all these stories even or particularly in the fictionalised ones based on his own life. For a person drunk on the film society culture prevalent in Kerala during the Seventies and Eighties, \\\"Rashomon\\\" is a magic word.|Akira Kurasowa\\u2019s film enjoys cult status among movie buffs. It is rivetting in its presentation of \\u201ctruth\\u201d in many layers, presented as a conversation among three people: a woodcutter, a priest and a commoner who take shelter under the ramshackle Rashomon city gates to escape a downpour. The story is the death (murder?) of a man, the rape (?) of a woman and the capture of a bandit responsible (?) for both: as the story unfolds, the differences in the widely varying testimonies of the people involved force us to have a rethink on what \\u201ctruth\\u201d means.|I had heard about this movie a lot before actually seeing it; and it lived up to its hype and more when I finally got around to seeing it. But this review is not about the movie. It is about the magical short story which was its inspiration \\u2013 and other stories like it, penned by one of the great figures of Japanese literatures, the turn-of-the-century novelist Ryunosuke Akutagawa.|When I first saw the movie, I was so taken up by the sheer visual beauty of Kurasowa\\u2019s storytelling that I did not ruminate much on what this movie was based on, even though I saw the \\u201cbased on\\u2026\\u201d title in the beginning. It was only after joining Goodreads that I came to know about this book, and was immediately hungry for it. Having read it, it has left me hungry for more by the same author, and Japanese literature in general. It is so shattering in its impact on the intellect, even in translation; I cannot imagine how powerful it must be in the original Japanaese \\u2013 for, as Haruki Murakami says in the introduction, the translation can never capture the power of the original.|Akutagawa is a tragic figure. His mother went mad shortly after his birth, and he was raised by his childless maternal uncle and aunt. Even though they were a highly cultured family and young Ryunosuke was lucky to have a childhood exposed to a lot of intellectual pleasures, he was constantly plagued by ill-health and bullying in school. His ill-health continued into youth: he suffered from chronic insomnia and fears of madness. The misfortunes of family and country also distressed his oversensitive soul to an inordinate extent. Until finally, on 24 July 1927, Ryunosuke Akutagawa committed suicide by an overdose of Veronal.|The author\\u2019s gifted and tortured soul is visible throughout this amazing collection of stories. It is divided into four sections: (1) A World in Decay, (2) Under the Sword, (3) Modern Tragicomedy and (4) Akutagawa\\u2019s Own Story. These sections correspond to four periods of Japanese history as well as four creative styles which took birth from Akutagawa\\u2019s fertile imagination.|In the first section, stories (most of them retelling of old legends) set in the Heian Period (A.C.E. 794 \\u2013 1185) are included. This was Japan\\u2019s classical era; a time of peace, prosperity and opulence when art and culture flourished. But as is common with most ancient kingdoms, it declined and power slipped from the hands of the aristocrats into the hands of the warlords. It is this twilight period that Akutagawa uses as a backdrop for his stories of degeneration and decay. The title story of the collection, Rashomon, encapsulates the entire misery of the country in the symbol of the gate of the capital city of Kyoto. The city having been struck by one calamity after another, the author says:|With the whole city in such turmoil, no one bothered to maintain the Rashomon. Foxes and badgers came to live in the dilapidated structure, and they were soon joined by thieves. Finally, it became the custom to abandon unclaimed corpses in the upper storey of the gate, which made the neighbourhood an eerie place that everyone avoided after the sun went down.|The stage is thus perfectly set for a set of disturbing stories. |Rashomon| narrates the story of a jobless servant who is sheltering from the rain inside the gate and an old woman, who steals hair from the corpses lying there to sell to wig-makers, justifying it by pointing out that the dead people were also thieves and cheaters. Ultimately, she inspires the servant to become a thief himself who starts off on his new career by stealing her clothes!|In a Bamboo Grove|, one of the most extraordinary stories ever written (this was the inspiration for Kurasowa\\u2019s film, even though he used the Rashomon gate as a symbol of the decay he was portraying) narrates story of a dead warrior, a thief and a raped woman from the viewpoint of each of the protagonists. Each of the stories is different and equally believable from the evidence available at the scene of the crime and the statements of the witnesses. Who we believe will depend a lot on who we are.|But the story which impressed me most in the whole volume is |Hell Screen|. This gem of a novelette gives us a taste of horror, Japanese style \\u2013 I could understand how movies like |Dark Water|, |The Ring| and |The Grudge| came into being. The tale of the deformed artist Yoshihide (nicknamed \\u201cMonkeyhide\\u201d because of his deformity), the tapestry of hell he paints for the Lord Horikawa, the artist\\u2019s daughter who is a serving girl at the Lord\\u2019s mansion and the pet monkey has all the elements of a medieval ghost story and a gothic romance. However, it is Akutagawa\\u2019s narrative style (whereby he leaves a lot unsaid) and his choice of the narrative voice (that of an unnamed member of the Lord\\u2019s retinue) that are masterful. The story is a one way ride into darkness.|In the second section, we move forward to the Tokugawa Shogunate (A.C.E. 1600 \\u2013 1868). This was the last feudal military government of Japan. During this period, the shogun elders of the Tokugawa clan ruled from Edo Castle. As Jay Rubin, the translator, says, the Tokugawa centralised feudalism \\u201cimposed the principle of joint responsibility on all parts of society, punishing whole families, entire villages, or professional guilds for the infractions of individual members. This fostered a culture based on mutual spying, which promoted a mentality of constant vigilance and self-censorship.\\u201d|In the story |Loyalty|, the disastrous effects of the madness of a samurai on an entire dynasty is described: in this merciless world, it does not mean just the destruction of a person, but of a whole bloodline. The other two stories included describe the clash between Christianity and Japan\\u2019s traditional religions. These distressing tales are rendered with much empathy and wit.|In the third section we find a sarcastic Akutagawa, full of black humour. |The Story of the Head that Fell Off| and |Horse Legs| use the trappings of fantasy to create a sort of darkly comic tale. In |Green Onions|, we can see an author smiling at himself and his fellow-scribes, in a pastiche of a romantic tale.|There is a whole tradition of autobiographical writing in Japan, called \\u201cI-Novels\\u201d, where the author\\u2019s life itself is fictionalised. Even though Akutagawa initially stayed away from this genre, he finally succumbed to peer and critic pressure and started writing such stories. It is here that one can see a fine mind finally unravelling. There are hints of this in the first three stories, especially in |The Writer\\u2019s Craft| where an author is forced write an elegy for somebody whom he barely knows; just on the strength of his writing talent. This sense of unease is increased in |Death Register| where he tabulates the demise of friends and relatives: and in |The Diary of a Stupid Man| and |Spinning Gears| (where Akutagawa keeps on hallucinating spinning gears on one side of his vision), we sense that we are standing on the edge of a minefield. (|Spinning Gears| was published posthumously.)|This is a well-chosen set of stories, with a fantastic introduction by Haruki Murakami. There are explanations about the historical periods, and background information on each story. The timeline of Akutagawa\\u2019s life is also provided. The book satisfies one, not only literally, but also as a window to Japanese literature.|Highly recommended.|Review also posted on my |\\n|BLOG|\\n|. Good, but...| Yes. I did it. I've committed one of the ultimate literary sacrileges of all time. I read Akutagawa Ryunosuke in translation when I could have read it in original Japanese. I am guilty as charged. I just couldn't resist a book with such a cool cover and Murakami's introduction |plus| his trusted Jay Rubin doing the translation. |Having said that, I did read it along with the actual Japanese text in front of me to see how well Jay Rubin has grappled with difficult early 19th-century Japanese and rendered it into English. And the result was somewhat disappointing. I think he does a good job translating Murakami's works, but here with Akutagawa, he pretty much butchers most of his early stories that take place in medieval Japan (which stories, by the way, are usually extolled as his masterpieces). The original Japanese is, of course, in medieval Japanese, and it is quite different from modern Japanese (but not as different as modern English to Chaucer's middle English). But Mr. Rubin sometimes translates conversations into highly colloquial English, and that just doesn't work with Akutagawa's early stories.|The Japanese language - still today and even more so back in the day - is a very |polite| language, which logically makes it a very |vague| language as well, where curse words don't really exist and you say things in a very roundabout way. And to render this into modern colloquial English is like equivalent to rendering Shakespeare into today's slang with an abundance of \\\"F\\\" and \\\"N\\\" and other such words. Now from a reader's point of view, Mr. Rubin's translation is very readable. Very. It could have, however, been a lot more conservative on the use of colloquialism and slang without compromising its readability. |For example, in one of the scenes, a lord tells his trusted servant to kill someone, and the original reads more or less, \\\"Kill that man, that Rin'emon,\\\" which Mr. Rubin translates as \\\"Kill that bastard!\\\" Alright. This does show the degree to which this guy is mad (in fact crazy), but I'm sorry, that just doesn't work. The word \\\"bastard\\\" is just way too much of a bad word for someone like a lord himself could utter (and I don't think there was an equivalent in medieval Japanese). I do recognize the difficulty since the Japanese here is very very subtle. The meaning is close to \\\"bastard,\\\" but a LOT less blatant than what the English word conveys. In many many instances Mr. Rubin resorts to colloquial English that sounds too jarring to a Japanese ear when compared to the subtle nuances and beauty of the original Japanese. But that's just me, who is fortunate enough to be able to read both Japanese and English with more or less equal fluency. So as far as the translation is concerned, hats off to Mr. Rubin for making Akutagawa's stories easily available for the English-speaking public, but as an artistic work, it could have done much better by avoiding too much colloquialism and using more formal (and even a bit archaic) English to better convey the original voice of the text.|W/r/t the stories, they are really good. I'd even say he's Japan's Chekhov. In fact, you could see an exotic blend of Kafka, Gogol, Chekhov, and even Dostoevsky at work behind these stories. My personal favorites are his famous \\\"Hell Screen\\\" (intense and just awesome), \\\"In the Bamboo Grove\\\" (Kurosawa's Rashomon is based on this), and \\\"Horse legs\\\" (which is very Kafkaesque and just funny). \\\"Loyalty\\\" is also excellent in terms of it psychological insights. Though I wasn't a big fan of his later, autobiographical stories, they were strangely engaging. It's just too bad that one of his most famous stories, \\\"Kappa,\\\" is not included in this collection. Overall, it's a good short anthology of Akutagawa's stories. I was Compelled to read this after loving Akira Kurosawa's classic film. Most of the stories are superb, with Akutagawa's prose full of such fluidity. He really catches you out with some beautiful quirks of description, sharp bouts of humour, and many revelations in a short space of time that it's no wonder he is considered one of Japan's greatest short-story writers.

About a third of these stories are easily knock-out 5-star fantastic. The other two-thirds I'd rate mostly 4 stars with a few 3 stars. All worth reading and in general I think this is probably a good intro to Akutagawa's work in that it contains a nice cross-section of his work from the earliest historical stories to his later primarily autobiographical stories.|I personally preferred the earlier stories which ranged from tales of Samurai warriors and Shoguns and stories of religious persecution when Christianity was making inroads in Japan to satyrical stories about unfortunates with big noses.* While the settings are completely foreign to me, the characters are people I know all too well. My favorite story being \\\"Hell Screen\\\" in which an egotistical painter is commissioned to paint a screen depicting the horrors of hell. In order to sketch the scenes, he puts his assistants through a myriad of tortures and all I'll add in an effort to not give too much away is that karma is a bitch! These early stories have an almost Victorian gothic creepiness to them but it's a bit more subtle and far more insidious in that it seems infinitely more real. And Akutagawa has a nice dollop of humor running throughout these early stories as well.|The later autobiographical stories in which he writes of his mother who went mad, of his infidelities and his fear of going mad himself and his increasing depression that led to his eventual suicide are painful to read in how human and easy to relate to they are. But having read Dazai's similarly themed autobiographical stories not too long ago, Akutagawa didn't have quite the gut punch that Dazai had for me. Akutagawa's story \\\"The Spinning Gears\\\" was the best of the autobiographical bunch for me. Throughout, he continues to have visions of gears that nearly block out his vision. Those of us who have the luxury to think about life beyond just worrying about food and shelter can probably all relate to this nightmare of the cogs of life just taking over. The horror element of his earlier stories definitely comes into play here.|There's a slightly strange intro to this collection by Haruki Murakami which is far more critical of Akutagawa's work than I might have expected though it did seem like a relatively fair critique. I'm glad I read it after reading the stories though.|-----------------------|*When I studied Chinese, my teachers were all native Chinese, mostly on exchange and when we learned the word for \\\"nose\\\" we also learned that Americans are frequently called \\\"big nose\\\" so I had a good chuckle seeing that the Japanese are equally amused by big noses. I always think I don't enjoy short story collections. There're sometimes one or two short stories that I find interesting but others often merge into the formless forgettable mass (unless it's Alice Munro and then there are none). Then I encounter a collection like this and start doubting my preconceived ideas about my relationship with the form. |This was a fascinating collection. Starting with Akutagawa's take on the old stories and ending with closely autobiographical confessions of the paranoid depressed macabre mind. |Akutagawa is very well-versed in the western literature, he's particularly attracted to the psychological novels of the 19th century. I can see Poe's eerie influence in \\\"Hell screen\\\" story (one of my favorite retellings of the old tales), I also see Gogol in \\\"Horse legs\\\". And then there's the heartbreaking cycle of autobiographical stories of unravelling mind. He is lonely, perturbed, obsessed with death, self-doubting and struggling with inferiority complex regarding his skills, continually calling himself an idiot. This is an anxious, ill mind you're uncomfortable to spend time in, not gonna lie. (the last two stories are published posthumously after he killed himself, the second story was left unfinished, his brain just gave up on concentration needed to finish a story)|All in all, a very interesting collection I recommend to everybody: first stories to lovers of myths and fables; and the last stories to lovers of psychological. What I love about Rashomon is that it signifies pretentious snobbery so perfectly. Like, if you want to impress someone at a cocktail party, \\\"I didn't understand truth until I saw Rashomon,\\\" you might say. Did I say impress? I meant impress upon them that you would be super boring to go on a date with. You can win any argument by nominating Rashomon because no real people have actually seen it.|Anyway, I haven't seen it.|I read the book though! Here it is! No, not the one called Rashomon. That's actually about something totally different. Rashomon the movie was mostly based on a different story by this same guy, called \\\"In a Bamboo Grove.\\\" I know this from |reading the introduction.| Would you like to go on a date with me and I'll tell you about a pretentious movie I haven't even seen.|What book do you think is the Rashomon of books? Like, how could you instantly signify that you're pretentious? Is it Proust?|Things You Can Signify With Books|On The Road:| I will not be good in bed.|Jane Austen:| I haven't read a classic since high school.|Ulysses:| oh, this is probably the pretentious one. |What's your idea? Tell me - YOU RIGHT THERE, I demand that you tell me a book and what it signifies when a person claims to be a big fan of it.|Whatever, here's the thing, those are both wonderful stories but who cares when you've got something called HELL SCREEN coming your way.|HELL SCREEN|*heavy metal music*|Hell Screen is so fucking great, it's this Poe / Wilde / Faust thing where an artist can only paint from life and then he's asked to paint hell and you can pretty much see where this is going. There's a monkey.|Akutagawa is one of Japan's most famous writers. He wrote mostly short stories like these here. He committed suicide in 1927 when he was 35, overdosing on sleeping meds across the room from his wife and kids. All of the stories I read in this collection were perfect. Look, it's not that HELL SCREEN is the best name for anything ever and any story not called HELL SCREEN is stupid, but...it's not not that, either.  Akutagawa known as the |\\u201cFather of Japanese short stories\\u201d| stays true to his designation with this collection of metaphysically refined stories. The rendered stories: - The Grove, Yam Gruel, Rashomon, Martyr to name a few; highlights Akutagawa\\u2019s preference for macabre themes of immortality, depression, virtue, chaos and death. These stories encompass a constant battle of skepticism prevailing over virtue of morality v/s existence of evil.| | In Rashomon, the act of the ghoulish old woman picking out long hairs from the skulls of the corpses to make wigs and sell them to buy scraps of food delineate a desperate act to fulfill the demonic perils of life. Similarly, 'Martyr' highlights the thriving soul of hypocrisy in religion and the susceptibility to strong gossip.| | Akutagawa\\u2019s affinity for such themes brings out his real tumultuous relation with mental anxiety and clinical neurotic dwelling of his personal life. (He committed suicide at the age of 35 due to an overdose of Vernol). Furthermore, his description of kimonos/garbs adorning his protagonists illustrates a high usage of the color blue which in Japanese culture is the color of naivety,immaturity and youth.|  First read in 2007|In his characteristically measured, conversational introduction to this book, Murakami Haruki tells us that Akutagawa is his third favourite author in the modern (post 1868) Japanese canon (after Soseki and Tanizaki). Rather than giddily enthusing about the author, Murakami carefully contextualises him in Japanese literature and culture. Akutagawa lived during a brief period of prosperity and political liberalism between WWI and the Depression in 1929, and combined appreciative immersion in Japanese cultural life with passion for Western literature. He called Soseki 'The Master', and worked as an editor as well as writing; the autobiographical stories in this collection demonstrate the literariness of his short life.|As well as drawing on his own daily experience and mental anguish for source material (a form related to the 'I-novel' style of some of his contemporaries in Japanese literature), Akutagawa wrote stories set in the Edo period when Japan was governed by military overlords. Many of these have interesting historical content. He also wrote stories of his own time, with an amusing self-awareness. The writer is always a presence, even if only in the pleasurable excess of musical names.|His style is clear, lyrical and pierced here and there by vivid images, like the purple sparks made by the tram on the overhead wires that the narrator wants to hold in his hands. Murakami says 'the flow of his language... moves along like a living thing', and this translation by Jay Rubin certainly preserves this natural, dynamic, unforced quality. |One technique that I particularly liked and that is original or at least unusual is the one he employs in 'Hell Screen' as well as other pieces, that of using a disapproving narrator to tell the hero's story. This device not only actively engages the reader's sympathy with the protagonists, but also creates a deep and nuanced impression of social exclusion and isolation. \\u201cThe cable was still sending sharp sparks into the air. He could think of nothing in life that he especially desired, but those purple sparks\\u2014those wildly-blooming flowers of fire\\u2014he would trade his life for the chance to hold them in his hands.\\u201d|I came upon a review comparing Akutagawa\\u2019s writing to \\u201cshoots of flame visible through the snow\\u201d (quoting a Mishima story), which is very apt. Akutagawa\\u2019s writing burns with a lurid glow\\u2014well suited to his macabre sense of humor. Less so in the later stories in this collection, with his fear of madness, and his thoughts of suicide (which he would eventually commit), and his misgivings about living a life of literature. DNF @ 39%|These stories are not bad but I just can't muster any real enthusiasm for them.|It is not helped by the stories being unconneced and by themselves not being great examples of the short story format.|Of course, they were not written as short stories in the Western literary sense. It's just that the way they are written is boring me stiff.|Maybe I'll pick this up again at a later date, but right now, this is not working for me. Akutagawa is one of my favorite writers. He took his own life with barbiturates at age 35 and left behind some 300 stories, sketches, articles and literary experiments. In English he has appeared in over a dozen collections of the same 20-30 most famous stories retranslated a dozen times. This latest collection, translated by the consummate Jay Rubin, has a lovingly detailed introduction by the inimitable Haruki Murakami. It is a mere sampling of 18 stories from his impossibly good body of work. Unlike Toson, Soseki and Tanizaki, Akutagawa did not embark on massive literary projects. Instead, he honed his craft with precision and an appreciation for classic storytelling. I have read some of his stories ten times, and they always elicit a strong response from me. |In a lot of ways, he resembles Gogol, and even composed an homage with his story \\\"The Nose.\\\" Though different in content, the tone is reminiscent of the Russian master. This is one of the masterpieces contained in this treasury. The others include: \\\"Rashomon, In a Bamboo Grove, Hell Screen, Spinning Gears, Death Register, and the Life of a Stupid Man.\\\" Even the ones that are not masterworks per se, are extremely entertaining. \\\"Green Onions, The Story of the Head that Fell Off, Horse Legs, and Loyalty\\\" fall into this category. If you are new to this author, you may not enjoy all of his tales, but I believe you will appreciate many aspects of his singular talent.|He writes a few different types of stories: 1). retellings of classic tales from Chinese and other sources. These read a little like fables. 2.) Autobiographical tales: these are often depressing, taking details of his haunted life and casting them bleakly against the backdrop of his times. 3). Religious tales like \\\"Christ of Nanking\\\" (not included in the collection) and others. Historical tales, taking place well before the author's time but possessing uncanny verisimilitude.|In his stories you will find traces of his influences: Anatole France, Strindberg, Merimee, Goethe, Nagoya Shiga, Soseki, Toson, Tanizaki, Basho, Doppo, Ogai, Pu Songling and dozens of other European and Chinese authors. He has rewritten stories from Pu Songling's collections as well as retold many from the seminal Japanese proto-mythologies.|Akutagawa draws from Buddhism, Shintoism, Christianity and Myth. I think he is one of the most interesting writers I have ever encountered because he processes other literary worlds into new forms. Even when he waxes esoteric, he is charming and insightful. He explores human nature with deep characters and memorable comedy and tragedy.|This brilliant edition includes thorough notes by Rubin explaining the finer points of the stories. There is enough material in this singular Penguin edition to write a dissertation on Akutagawa. Jay Rubin has put in an astounding effort toward accuracy and illumination. I only wish he would continue with further volumes of stories.|If you appreciate the stories of Chekhov, Gogol, Maupassant, and Dostoyevsky, you will find a lot to love about this author. Typically, you can expect tortured artists, explorations of morality and death, futility and hope, love and loss. Very classic themes. \\\"Green Onions\\\" and \\\"O-gin\\\" were odd but welcome selections for this book. Overall, it is the most well-rounded collection of the author's writings in English.|I have so far discovered 107 Akutagawa tales in English. I've read every anthology of Japanese literature, every collection of his tales and tracked down out of print Japanese-American periodicals through JSTOR. I want to thank Ryan C. K. Choi and N. A. Feathers for publishing new translations of his work on their websites. This incredible author has not gotten a full treatment in English and I implore translators to get to work on making his complete works available. So far we have only about 900 pages of stories, when obscure, ancient masters like Pu Songling have been translated more comprehensively. Along with this collection you will want to read two more collections: Mandarins, translated by Charles de Wolf, and The Beautiful and Grotesque, which includes \\\"Kappa,\\\" his novella.|Though Akutagawa's accomplishment is profoundly important (far more so, I would argue, than Murakami claims in his indicting introduction), one wonders what heights Akutagawa might have reached had he endured the agonies of his intellectual rigors for decades longer. Was he capable of writing novels? Were the demons he wrote about in \\\"Spinning Gears\\\" exaggerated or as sincerely recorded as in Strindberg's Inferno? These questions will never be answered. But part of his appeal is how digestible and varied his work is.|This is undoubtedly one of the greatest short story collections by any Japanese or non-Western author. Throughout my life I've been experiencing the strangest tendency when reading a really great literary work: after finishing a particularly brilliant passage/story/poem, I just have to put the book down for while, to stop reading it altogether as if I was afraid that this was the peak and nothing better will follow. Sometimes this takes days of sweet pondering upon the writer's craft. I like savouring these moments, they occur rarely, bringing me much pleasure and gently nudging me into thinking about beauty. Many Akutagawa's short stories gave me this feeling, especially those that were about medieval Japan and the samurai (especially |In a Bamboo Grove|, |Hell Screen| or |Loyalty|). I find it extremely hard to comment on such brilliantly crafted small literary worlds. It's always difficult to describe perfection, you just have to experience it and then you know: this is |it|. I feel the compliments are also in order for Jay Rubin, the translator, who rendered these stories so beautifully into English.|On the other hand, this book seemed utterly depressing to me. Akutagawa is preoccupied with death and suicide in quite an unhealthy manner, which is surely due to his mental illness. Naturally, this issue is a fact of life, not a bad thing in itself, but the way this volume is compiled and filled with incredibly elaborate commentary on the autobiographical element of his writing, one sort of feels like sinking into that utter darkness with the author (the most dismal posthumously published stories are ordered in the end of this compilation). Thus, Akutagawa would be one of those artists that I put into a special category of mine - the writers that I consider truly gifted (if not even genius), but for various reasons I can't relate to them personally. |His own works were unlikely to appeal to people who were not like him and had not lived a life like this| ...as Akutagawa wrote himself. He tells us later that he is the one that believes in the existence of darkness only, not in the light. It leaves me just wondering how much of this is the result his depression or unhappy personal circumstances and how much the influence of fin-de-si\\u00e8cle literature he was devouring, an influence on his life that is duly acknowledged. |So, there he is - a master of words, a strange man... I guess this is the black and the white of this reading experience. A damn intense reading experience. Pre-review:| to tell the truth, the reason why I finally got my lazy butt up to seriously read contemporary Japanese literature (aside from the usual reads of Haruki Murakami, Yukio Mishima, Rampo Edogawa and all the other Japanese crime and mystery good stuff etc) is this: the |Bungo Stray Dogs manga seriess| LOL|\\n|\\n|Early this mornin', when you knocked upon my door|Early this mornin', ooh, when you knocked upon my door|And I said, \\\"Hello, Satan, I believe it's time to go\\\"|Me and the devil, was walkin' side by side|Me and the devil, ooh, was walkin' side by side|-Me and the Devil Blues-|Robert Johnson|\\n|\\n|(1) So far I am still in the Introduction part, but an introduction written by Haruki Murakami is definitely worth reading, for example, the part he commented as a novelist that Akutagawa's use of language is 'sharp and beautiful', the way he analysed another artist's works, his personal history and faimly history and the historical background! And it doesn't surprise me that he compares Akutagawa with Fitzgerald! (the short essay Murakami had written about Fitzgerald is beautiful as well). |(2) The Nose is an interesting case study of human emotions of shame, pity, self-image and malice.|(3) the fact that Rashomon is among Akutagawa's first short stories is quite impressive, and in Chinese we still use the term 'Rashomon effect' a lot. LOL|(4) When I was re-reading |The Spider Spread| and |Hell Screen|, I feel a sense of despair: Heaven is too far away but Hell and its darkness is hot on everyone's heels.|(5) But somehow I think the movie adaptation of 'Rashomon' (actually the movie is the mixture of the short stories |'Rashomon'| and |'In a Bamboo Grove'|) is a bit more impressive than its novel counterpart.|More to come. \\\"Rashomon\\\" tells the story of a \\\"lowly servant\\\" sheltering from the rain on the steps of a rashomon (outer castle gate). He has recently been laid off and sits pondering his future. He hears a sound and ventures inside the rashomon to see what it was. Inside are heaps of dead bodies from the recent plague and a strange old woman wandering about, going through the corpses' clothes. The servant attacks the old woman, strips her of her clothing, throws her onto the heap, and runs off. |\\\"In a Bamboo Grove\\\" features a married couple and a robber. The story is told from the perspective of all witnesses and it emerges that the husband was murdered but who did it and why is the mystery. |These are the two most famous Akutagawa stories and are an excellent start to the collection. However, afterwards they become quite mediocre and even a bit tedious. The forced gothic of \\\"Hell Screen\\\" plods along until a near hysterical ending that undermines the seriousness of the story, that of obssession and the artistic mind. \\\"The Nose\\\" is a very odd story about a priest with a very big nose, has it shortened, and it grows back again. It's one of those \\\"be grateful for what you have, accept who you are\\\" type tales and not nearly as brilliant as Gogol's \\\"The Nose\\\" (Gogol being one of Akutagawa's influences and, frankly, a better short story writer). |As the title suggests there are 18 stories here but those are the only ones I can remember. The last couple in the section called \\\"Akutagawa's Own Story\\\" are interesting, with \\\"Life of a Stupid Man\\\" playing with form and presenting an interesting take on autobiography through small snippets of a life glimpsed in passing. \\\"Spinning Gears\\\" is the final story he wrote before his suicide (pills) and is about the slowly disintegrating mind of Akutagawa. The desperation and mounting paranoia give the reader an insight into Akutagawa's fragile and fractured mindset. The strange imagery is also fascinating. The spinning gears he sees around his eyes confuse and scare him while at every turn he sees signs of death - a decaying animal corpse, dying people in hospitals, and above all his morbid fear of going insane like his mother. |I won't say I didn't enjoy the book as there were some stories here that were excellent, and whether it's Jay Rubin's translation or not, the writing was always of a high standard. And students of literature will find reading \\\"Rashomon\\\" and \\\"In a Bamboo Grove\\\" very rewarding as will film students who are interested in the work of Kurasawa who based his film \\\"Rashomon\\\" on those stories. But compared to other short story writers and other Japanese writers, Akutagawa isn't nearly on their level.  Delving into Japanese classics had always been a goal of mine since I started reading more frequently. Akutagawa Ryunosuke was the first Japanese author I've read of with his work Life of a Stupid Man, an incredible piece of literature in my opinion. So here I am delving into his more of his works.|Instead of talking about this book in general, I will make a weekly discussion to dissect each short stories in depth on my Instagram @agathachristiebells. I will try not to be spoilery but if you have read it or maybe wanted to know more, there are amazing reviews and analysis online that talked about the stories in more details.|CW: suicide|Akutagwa Ryunosuke was known as Japanese Father of Short Stories. His sharp literary style and usage of language were never stagnant: \\\"it moves along like a living thing\\\". He published Rashomon in 1916 at the age of 23-years-old and was praised by the legendary writer Natsume Soseki. Akutagawa brilliantly crafted a story from classical works into a contemporary modernist literature that transcend generation. Unfortunately, he commited suicide at the age of 35, in which he wrote actively for only twelve years in his career. |1.Rashomon (1915)|Rash\\u014dmon in Kyoto was the grander of the two city gates built during\\u00a0the Heian period (794\\u20131185). In this story, calamity had struck the city of Kyoto caused a decline to the capital. Set in Heian Period, it is a tale of an ex-servant who in a precarious situation of being left homeless after he was fired from a job. In order to survive the night of a stormy weather, he decided to take cover in the abandoned gates filled with corpses. He then encountered an old woman suspiciously prodding around the corpses.|This was fairly short with 7 pages long of we looking at the unnamed character and his actions and decisions in the moment. There is an internal struggle of choices between surviving but with a price to pay or died alongside the corpses. There is symbolism in here that subtly present though not obvious and I found it on a reread, they are much clearer. This one was a good introduction in this book and sets the pace of the book well. |2. Hell Screen|Yoshihide was known to be the best painter but with an ugly face and not an ounce of compassion to others with an exception of his daughter. When he is tasked to create a painting of Hell Screen by Lord Horikawa, a powerful authority whom coveted his talent but despised Yoshihide's unseemingly arrogant behaviour who thinks he is above others and his disrespect towards culture and religion, Yoshihide fell into the dark abyss of hell on earth. |This story depicted artistic obsession and dilemma similarly Akutagawa was towards his writing. Yoshihide is obssesed with his art and the only emotion of love he had was for his adolescent daughter, a compassionate and mild mannered girl. Yoshihide's passion towards art border into madness as he painted from observation and gained the picture by real life depiction rather than imagination such as rotting corpses and dreams of his encounter with the Hell Wardens.|His tendencies to paint real life depictions gave the authentic feeling to his painting but he sacrificed many things in order to reach the state. His sacrilegious behaviour torturing his apprentices indicate his manic tendencies to achieve perfection even go as far as the act of a devil. This story blew my mind. Its so briliantly written with introduction to characters, the peak of insanity, unexpected and twisted climax which ends on a depressing conclusion. A well crafted story that showed human's greed and jealousy can burns the world as if hell exists even in the real life. |3. In a Bamboo Grove|A reread. I have read this short story three times and it still remains vague and ambiguous on the actual truth. |The story questioned on how our memory can be unreliable and each persons had their own subjective experiences on seeing the same things thus giving different answers to one question. |It started with the testimony of a woodcutter then a travelling priest, a policeman and an old woman on the killing of a 26-year-old Kanazawa no Takehiro who found stabbed in a bamboo grove. We then get a confession from the killer, the wife of Takehiro Masago and in the end, the spirit's confession himself through a medium. What really interest me was the fact all 3 people involved in this incident had different stories showed that they either embelish or exaggerate their stories according to their own principles. One in anger, another for honour and lastly to subdue the shamefullness because of lust. Its an interesting take on how we convey our words in order to make it look differently from others.|In the end, we don't know the absolute truth as we can only relies on the statements and confession given by the witnesses and suspect as each person gave their words according to their own advantage either to save honour or cover for others. It was left to our own interpretation.|TW: sexual assault, physical assault, animal cruelty, arson, suicide|The second section of the book titled Under the Sword comprised of 3 stories: Dr Ogata Ryosai's Memorandum, O-gin and Loyalty. |In this section, the stories mostly based during the period of rules by Tokugawa shogun. Tokugawa ruled the country with power and force in fear of any rebellion and being overthrown. This time, the fear or threat from Christianity religion which is starting to make an impact on the people, Tokugawa was afraid of this thus there are punishment and execution for those who practiced the faith. |4. Dr Ogata Ryosai's memorandum ( 1916)|Following the memorandum of Doctor Ogata, this reports on a widow named Shino who has a young daugther that fallen ill. She was a practising Kirishitan or Christian thus causing her to be abhored and pushed away from the neighbours. In desperate need for help, she seeks Dr Ogata to see her daughter's sickly state but due to her religion, the doctor refused unless she abandoned the faith. |Interestingly, this story pit religion and family together. Its a story that shows the choice between keeping your religion or choose your flesh and blood. Certainly, its a notion that is cruel but soon we will see what fate arrived to Shino as she decided on her own as she was pushed to commit an unwilling act for her daughter. In the end, there is a twist of fate and it may seems unbelievable but a miracle do occur.|5. O-gin|Opposite to the miracle in the earlier story, this one questioned the choice make by the character. O-gin is an orphan girl who lost both of her parents at young age and she was adopted by a couple who are Christian though not many people know about it. They however were caught by the Satan and brought to the magistrate for cruel punishment and forced to denounce their faith. At the time of execution, O-gin decision to back away from Christian crumbles down as she realized she can never go to Heaven and abandon her birth parents whom she believed are in the depths of Hell.|This story made me think a lot on the choice of religion and family again. Being loyal to the religion in here meaning you are abandoning your family but O-gin decided to not be selfish and instead chose her parents. Its a debate of choice and weighing the importance of these two things in life. This will make an interesting discussion.|TW: murder, decapitation, graphic violence|6. Loyalty|This is fascinating as the terms loyalty coined to the person served to a bloodline. In here, we see a head of a household, a samurai started to have fits and nervous breakdown that ultimately led him being out of boundary and potentially harming the family's name. The Elder of the House decided that the master should refrain himself from attending any events that take place in the castle in fear of him embarassing or bring disgrace to the family. The elder is more loyal to serve the house than his own master thus lead to him being almost killed but instead he left the house, no longer want to serve the family. The next elder appointed is more accustomed or acquaintard with the house master as he seen him grew up and here, he is more loyal to the master than the house itself. So you see there is a different loyalty in the same household. There is a disatrous event occured after the master decision to go to the castle for last time before he retired causing the destruction of his whole bloodline. |Around this time, Akutagawa himself seems to be having his own nervous breakdown. This story may reflected his own mental state as the main character seems to fear almost everything and lashed out whenever something ticks him. |7. The story of the head that fell off |Set in the backdrop of Sino-Japanese War where tension is rising between China and Japan, war destroyed many people. Xiao-er, a chinese man went to a fight with Japanese cavalrymen and as he clash swords with them, he felt a sword hit his neck and then he ran away atop of his horse to flee from the dire situation. He fell from the horse, on the verge of his death, his past life started to passed by him in shapes of the clouds, his mother's apron, the field of his home, the foot of a woman he loved and the festival he attended. Slowly, he startdd to regret his past actions and want to live a better life. Soon after, a newspaper stated an accident of a human head falls off after a brawl in a diner. |This story was sort of a dark comedy/humor because there is a twisted ending of the man. Regrets came too late for him despite many things. In a way, this story showed that humans somehow will always make bad decision even though they always said they will do better next time.|7/9/2021|8. Green Onions|Interestingly, in here Akutagawa breaks the fourth wall and was present in the story by saying he need to complete this story in order to meet a deadline. It gave a slight humor although as always, there is something to be taken from the story itself. |O-Kimi, a beautiful young waitress in a cafe had fallen in love with a young charming Tanaka. O-Kimi had this childlike or romantic notion of love , potraying the ideal image of Tanaka but she also knows that he could not possibly be perfect. However, when someone is in love, they tend to put a rose tinted glasses on and admire the person so much, they will look past their lacking. When both of them are on a date, Tanaka harbours an ill intent that may occur if not for O-Kimi's attention diverted to green onions on display in the street neighbourhood. What exactly is the significance?|Simple as it is, she was awaken to the reality of economic and financial situation she was in after seeing the green onions' price. She was worried about her rents, next meal payments, and obligations in her life other than romantic relationship with Tanaka. There is a potential danger when Tanaka invited O-Kimi to a house they are supposed to go but this was stopped by his sight of her with the green onions on her arms. As if all intent vanished the moment he sees her that way. |9. Horse Legs|This is fascinating. Hanzaburo suddenly passed away but turns out, this was a mistake by the grim reapers and they eventually returned him back to the living world. However, here's the problem, Hanzaburo had died three days ago, his legs had start to become rotten and in order to cover this mistake, the grim reapers replaced his legs with horse legs. Hanzaburo was devastated and in order to conceal this hideous facts, he kept his legs in boots all the time and never let other people see his legs.|Content warning: Death, suicide, attempted suicide, affairs|10. Life of a Stupid Man|\\\"I am living now in the unhappiest happiness imaginable. Yet, strangely I have no regrets\\\" |\\\"I may wear the skin of an urbane sophisticate, but in this manuscript I invite you to strip it off and laugh at my stupidity\\\" |I almost cried just by reading these words. |This was my 3rd time reading this stories. Its an autobiographical stories comprised of 51 short anthologies or rather I would call it Akutagawa's musings on his life and principles. It was published posthumously after his death by his close friend. Attached to the manuscript was his letter to him which said he is entitled to release this stories but must not identify or put a names to the people he spoke about. |Cadavers|\\\"If I needed a corpse, I'd kill someone without the slightest malice. Of course, the reply stated where it was - inside his heart\\\"|Man-made wings|\\\"At twenty nine, life no ponger held any brightness for him, but Voltaire supplied him with man made wings. |\\\"The higher he flew, the farther below him sank joyd and sorrows of a lifr bathed in the light of intellect\\\"|We started with his descriptions of his mother whom he described as lunatic and whom he barely have any affection for but also afraid he becomes like her as he lives each days with fear. Then, we moved slowly as he grow to become a writer but pressured to concur with the writing industry, married to a woman he loves but end up in affairs, growing passion for arts and philosophy but also contradict most of them, become a father but felt he is useless and unsuitable and each time he muses on death and what does it mean to live. |The Birth|\\\"Why did this one have to be born - to come into the worls like all the others, this world so full of suffering?\\\" |Comic Puppet|\\\"He wanted to live life so intensely that he could die at any moment without regrets\\\"|Stuffed Swan (this particularly hits me the hardest)|\\\"As he thought about his life, he felt both tears and mockery welling up inside him. All that lay before him was madness or suicide\\\"|I couldn't put into words or make a proper dissection on this one because its personal and raw and basically him telling his own stories in the most vulnerable state he was in, secrets being unburied, darkest desires and emotions being poured out, philosophy shared and contradicted and generally him saying he is unable to be a man worth enough to live. Its quite painful in a away but subtly conveyed in each short passages he wrote. |Interestingly enough, he wrote these using third point of view as if it was another person but it was actually him. Maybe he tries to separate the creation he wrote about from his life but he knows so well it is him and will always be him. |11. Death Register|In here, we see his life in full lights with him describing the death of his insane mother, an elder sister he barely knew, and the father who left him when he was an infant but always tried to reconcile with him somehow. Akutagawa doesnt get love from his real parents but he was given plenty by his adoptive parents. This was poetic and lyrical piece of essay he wrotes on each of his family members and ones that I felt most attached to was his recall of his father's dying on his deathbed. Such a sad moment. The story ended with a haiku as went to visit the graves of his beloved, his thoughts of them dying as if they are fortunate enough to die rather than live.|12. Dragon: The Old Potter's Tale (1919)|- Similar to The Nose, this story also points out on appearance and religion where the Buddhist monk named E'in had a giant nose and this caused him to be the centre of jokes by many. In order to divert the attention from his looks, he concoct a revenge by putting a signboard saying that a dragon will ascend to heaven on the third month. The words spread around like wildfire, even if people had doubts, majority believed the news and soon anticipate the event. Eventually, the day come and thousand of people gather to see the dragon but does this dragon even exist?|The theme of religion and physical appearance were themes that Akutagawa explored most in his work and this one spark more interest in the question of whether the prank could actually be true. Jay Rubin mentioned \\\"Dragon\\u00a0toys with the likelihood that religion is nothing more than mass hysteria, a force so powerful that even the fabricator of an object of veneration can be taken in by it.\\\"\\u00a0|The question whether the dragon does ascend remain vague as we are unsure whether it exist or the people in the midst of waiting for hours too invested in the notion of wanting and believing the dragon, conjure up the image of dragon. Its fascinating but as always the ending remain inconclusive. |13. The Spider Thread (1918)|Its a very short story but concise in conveying the message. Talked about sinner's and how one act of compassion lead to a help from the lord above but a greed will cause the downfall. Kandata, a vicious murderer was punished in the lowest of Hells but his action of letting a spider live ultimately gave him a help to climb to heaven by the spider thread. There are depiction of gruesome hell and its a terrifying scene. For someone as selfish as Kandata who won't share his help from above with others eventually lead to his eternal damnation in Hell |An interesting twist of fate is that I was surprised that an anime Erased I just finished watching had a connection with this story I read yesterday. The anime talked about this short story and it was so twisted in the mind of a person and I was pleasantly surprised by the coincidence.|It was published for children based on Taisho fairy tales|14. Spinning Gears Verdant vignettes vibrate across the reader\\u2019s eyes, as the are drawn into the splendiferous similes which dance across the page, shimmering like the pale reflection of sun-light on pebbles in a Japanese garden. Akutagawa fused he aesthetics of haiku with the psychology of Dostoevsky and other Western writers; style and form are as central to his stories as structure, psychology and characters, yet few short story writers are able to match the sheer diversity of Akutagawa\\u2019s ouvre; whether it be Gogolian fantasy in \\u2018The Nose\\u2019, discourses on the power of art in \\u2018Hell Screen\\u2019 or proto magical realism in \\u2018Horse Legs\\u2019, the breadth of Akutagawa\\u2019s stories in immense.|The highlight of these stories is undoubtedly \\u2018Hell Screen\\u2019, a macabre exploration of the darker elements of artistic inspiration, as the titular character, the morose and morbid painter Yoshide, tortures others to gain inspiration for his depiction of hell. Other highlights include, \\u2018In a Budding Grove\\u2019 which explores the nature of narrative perspective and was the inspiration for Kurosawa\\u2019s \\u2018Rashomon\\u2019 and \\u2018Spinning Gears\\u2019 a playful and poetic l pieces which reminders the reader of the jejunish experimental fiction of Oulipo. |Interspersed within the short stories are some strikingly pretty images, such as;|\\u201cPine boughs stretched across the empty sky, and in them hung a copper-coloured moon devoid or radiance.\\u201d|\\u201cA butterfly fluttered it\\u2019s wings in a wind thick with the smell of seaweed.

It was an abundant field of ripened wheat sprinkled with wild roses\\u201d) or of the aspiring artist, Yasukichi, whose cloyingly clich\\u00e9d funeral orations are held in higher regards than his art. More than this, his stories are about love and disillusions and jjoys there is something quintessentially modern the urban romance in \\u2018Green Onions\\u2019. Akutagawa is, along with Chekhov and Katherine Mansfield, one of the greatest short story writers.  I would highly recommend this edition which has introductions by Haruki Murakami and translator Jay Rubin. Additional commentary and notes by Jay Rubin help you to understand background of stories. Akutagawa basically created many of his stories from ancient Japanese fables. However His autobiographical stories rely on theme of loneliness and death. I have found this theme in all other Japanese literature which I read. If you want to read Japanese literature then I think Akutagawa's name should be at top of your list. Japan's highest litaeture award is named after Him. |I got to know Ry\\u016bnosuke Akutagawa in 2014 because of art movie Ghost Dog : Way of The Samurai. Jim Jarmusch is one of my most favourite filmmaker and I absolutely devour His movies. The film borrows a lot of elements from French movie Le Samoura\\u00ef, Seijun Suzuki's Branded to Kill.|Just like central character of Le Samoura\\u00ef, Ghost Dog lives his criminal life with Samurai code. He is seen oftenly reading Hagakure by Yamamoto Tsunetomo and shows liking to Ry\\u016bnosuke Akutagawa's rashomon and recommends it to a minor character.  The stories included in this collection reflect an author who is intelligent, well-read, perceptive and deeply aware of human foibles. Half of the short stories are very entertaining and revealing, written in the cadences of ancient Eastern folk tales. |The author wrote these stories in the book in the years 1915 to 1925, in Japan, using Chinese and Japanese literary and cultural themes. But they not only educate the reader in the themes of Eastern literature, they also demonstrate that humanity is the same whether living in the East or West, no matter what century. The way people feel about the mysteries of their lives is the same whatever the setting. At the same time, the different, distinctly Eastern cultural prism through which our commonalities present themselves reflect a Japanese view in these stories that is a bit mystifying, and very interesting. |This collection includes two very famous stories, \\u2018Rashomon\\u2019 and \\u2018In a Bamboo Grove\\u2019, which were combined together into the plot of a famous Japanese movie, which in turn Hollywood has not so aptly attempted to imitate in several variations. A character\\u2019s character in point of view is certainly shown to be important in deciding veracity of a tale! |For the record, in the story Rashomon I believe the ghost, Tekehiro, is the most truthful. I believe he incorrectly reads his wife's actions and motivations, but he was the most truthful as he understood what happened.|Tekehiro\\u2019s wife, Masago, saw in Tekehiro what she interpreted as contempt in his face after she was raped. I believe she misread her husband's emotion. She saw what she feared most. She continuously lost consciousness and was extremely stressed. She had been raped, after all. Tajomaru, the rapist, was also a braggart and a criminal. He probably did not feel he would be let go or considered innocent after his capture by authorities. He would be most interested in inflating his actions, so I don't believe him in that there was a fight between him and Tekehiro. |After raping her, Tajomaru, I think, added insult to injury and tormented Masago, only increasing her distress and her certainty that her husband would despise her. In reality (?!?), the thief only wanted to rape, torment and rob the couple. Masago would have been wild with shame and fear of rejection by her husband, as well as feeling hopeless in having been degraded. |Tekehiro would have been dishonored and shamed by his impotence, greed, dupability and perhaps his suspicion that his wife lost respect for him. This would lead him to believe she could easily want him dead for that, and thus he would be blind to how she might be hiding her own shameful acts of wanting to save her life and honor by going with the thief, whom she believed wanted to take her with him (I think that's what he whispered to her in the short story). |The thief forced her to publicize her choice of living over loyalty, so, by his trick, she shamed herself twice over by her choice of deserting her husband. When the thief revealed his trick, she was triply humiliated - first the rape, and then her choice of deserting her husband, then in being fooled and rejected. After the thief left (why would he untie the husband, realistically?) I think, unable to face her wretched self-betrayal and afraid of her husband's supposed need for revenge and rage, she did try to stab him, but perhaps incompetently. She was 19, a young girl. After she ran away, her husband killed himself in self-loathing. The girl's mom said he was kind at heart, and he was a man of honor. At least that's how it makes sense to me, given what I know of human nature.|Of course, uncertain narrators abound, so what all of us judges can go by is what we know of human nature along with the testimony. Akutagawa has made the reader one of the characters in the story, has he not? As judges, truth must be assigned as a probability instead of a certainty. Although I believe in my above synopsis as the closest truth, Tajomaru confessed. I believe he raped and robbed and played a horrible spiteful trick on the couple which doomed the marriage, but as a judge, I don't believe he dueled or killed the husband physically. Tajomaru committed soul murders on the couple, perhaps. But Tajomuro has confessed out of misplaced pride and braggedo, and I'm happy to condemn him for the murder, given no other physical evidence.|The author is so clever. Now WE know the uncertainty of determining truth of phenomena which is dependent on human interpretations of reality. I have become an unreliable narrator.|I completely disbelieve the Woodcutter. Despite appearances of being disinterested, his story does not make any sense unless you accept the complete dissonance of a young wife being more like a hardened psychopathic prostitute moments after being abducted, imprisoned, and raped, by an armed man threatening death and humiliation. |Later stories included in the book, from 1925 to 1927 are more autobiographical or personal, and while revealing how similar that people feel about fear, stress, anxiety, and how we live within communal society, sadly, these somewhat autobiographical stories show how the author is losing his equilibrium and peace of mind. It is difficult to parse out if it is the fear of going insane or if it is actual instability precipitating the author\\u2019s emotional frailty. When I read my first Murakami, a compilation of short stories called \\\"After the Quake,\\\" I was amazed by his refreshing originality. Some of his stories, indeed, had the effect of an earthquake to me. There were jolting, sudden and unexpected turns. In one, a man and a woman, after a brief introduction, make love. Then, out of nowhere, the man felt a sudden impulse to kill her. In another story, the characters were on a beach. Tears suddenly flow down from the eyes of one character, then they talk of killing themselves. Developments like these come without warning as they were not even hinted in the previous narration.|Now, it can be told. This style of storytelling is not at all original. Murakami, I think, copied it from this great Japanese writer who killed himself in 1927 at the age of 35--Ryunosuke Akutagawa (in the list of the 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die he's under letter \\\"R\\\"--a mistake, because his surname is Akutagawa, not Ryunosuke). By his own confession, Murakami has been reading Akutagawa since he was a teenager.|I bet that if one includes Rashomon in that compilation \\\"After the Quake\\\" an uninitiated reader will not find any difference between it and the rest of the stories there except that the latter have modern settings while \\\"Rashomon\\\" is set in 12th century Japan.|\\\"Rashomon\\\" (\\\"Mon\\\" being the Japanese for gate) was an outer castle gate, specifically the great southern main entrance to Kyoto during the Heian Period. It had massive pillars, towering archways and several chambers. The whole city of Kyoto, at the time of the story, was under civil unrest. People were hungry, even the Rashomon itself had become dilapidated for lack of proper maintenance. In the upper chamber thereof was dumped the city's dead, the victims of the prevailing hunger and violence.|In the lower chamber sits a servant who had just lost his job. He is said to be waiting for the rain to stop but he knows that even if the rain stops he really has nowhere to go and nothing to do. He had come to the dreadful conclusion that he would either die of starvation or survive by being a thief.|The mood is somber, the descriptive prose is elegant, fluid and spontaneous. Just like Murakami (in his short stories). Then the servant sees something...Thereafter comes one event after another which felt like Murakami's earthquakes, with a similar ending that leaves unanswered questions.|In the Introduction to the life and works of Akutagawa a Japanese literary critic, in 1917, described him (Akutagawa) as \\\"a writer who can't write without props.\\\" I was amused by this because elsewhere in goodreads before, discussing Kafka on the Shore with a Murakami fanatic K.D., I wrote that Murakami had used a lot of juvenile, ineffective props here (like talking cats, mother and son fucking, eels falling down from the sky, etc.) which were not even original as you can see parallels from Greek mythology and even in works of Lewis Carroll. |The Introduction also declared:|\\\"Sheer technique...though skillfully applied, does not necessarily translate into original literature. A fictional world that was not truly (the author's) own and that used borrowed containers would eventually reach and impasse and come to stand in his way like a high wall. Further pursuit of fictional method could only yield technical polish. And not surprisingly, the novelty would wear thin and readers would tire of seeing the same devices.\\\"|Wow, I myself could have said this after reading Kafka on the Shore! Now, guess who wrote this introduction? Close your eyes and bang your head on the wall--Haruki Murakami himself.|LOL! In his (undated ... perhaps 2006?) introduction, Haruki Murakami gives us what he thinks would be Japan's 10 most important \\\"writers of national stature\\\". They are writers that \\\"left us works of the first rank that vividly reflect the mentality of the Japanese people ... [the works] must have the power to survive at least a quarter century after the writer's death. ... The important thing is whether each of them as an individual human being embraced an awareness of the great questions of the age, accepted his or her social responsibility as an artist on the front line, and made an honest effort to shape his or her life accordingly.\\\"|Haruki believes the top 10 to be:|#1. |S\\u014dseki Natsume|. Equal #2 are: 2.|Akutagawa Ry\\u016bnosuke|, 2.|\\u014cgai Mori|, 4.|Shimazaki To son|, 5.|Shiga Naoya|, 6.|Jun'ichir\\u014d Tanizaki|, 7.|Yasunari Kawabata|. Equal #8 are: 8.|Osamu Dazai|, 8.|Yukio Mishima|.|He can't think of a tenth name for the list(!). Which is cute if you are a fan of |Kenzabur\\u014d \\u014ce|. Haruki is such a bitch. He goes on to say that \\\"Kawabata's works, to be honest, have always been a problem for me. ... I have never been able to identify very closely with his fictional world.\\\" And \\\"With reagrd to Shimazaki and Shiga, I can only say that I have no particular interest in them ... what I have read has left little trace in my memory.\\\"|So old Kenzaburo has been excluded from Haruki's list of 10 ... which only includes 9 ... and of which, 3 he really doesn't have time for? Ouch.|But Haruki's obviously mad. He seems to say that |Botchan| can be \\\"memorized whole by most school children\\\". What?|On to Akutagawa ... I liked the \\\"I\\\" stuff the best. [3.25 stars]|Akutagawa's short stories are so engaging, and his use of words is very thoughtful. Some of them are very humorous, and the others havs poignant social messages. |Haruki Murakami, who wrote an introduction for this book, says, |\\\"The flow of his language is the best feature of Akutagawa's style. Never stagnant, it moves along like a living thing. His choice of words is intuitive, natural-and beautiful.\\\"|The titular story, Rash\\u014dmon, is an exquisite work which shows how morality could be at odds with the need for survival. It is very profound. |Other stories which I liked include:|\\u2022\\\"The Bamboo Grove\\\" (which I'd read and reviewed separately much earlier)|\\u2022\\\"The Nose\\\", a satire on public perception of one's appearance |\\u2022\\\"The Hell Screen\\\", a shocking story about a painter who goes insane in the process of finishing his magnum opus (a piece showcasing what hell would be like) and allows his innocent daughter to be set on flames in order to further the realistic nature of his art. |\\\"I could have sworn that the man's eyes were no longer watching his daughter dying in agony, that instead the gorgeous colors of flames and the sight of a woman suffering in them were giving him joy beyond measure.\\\"|\\u2022\\\"Dr. Ogata Ry\\u014dsai: Memorandum\\\" and \\\"O-Gin\\\" showed the early days of Christianity in Japan, and how followers of that sect were at odds with the other people around them and with the hostile government, as their faith is challenged at every turn. These were very interesting to read. |\\u2022\\\"The Story of a Head That Fell Off\\\" is a Chinese story depicting the horrors of war, and the people who fight those wars. |\\\"Xiao-er was overcome by a mysterious loneliness such as he had never experienced before. The vast blue sky hung above him in silence. People had no choice but to go on living their pitiful lives beneath that sky, buffeted by the winds that blow down from above. What loneliness! And how strange, he thought, that he had never known this loneliness until now.\\\"|\\u2022\\\"Horse Legs\\\" is arguably the most humorous story in this collection. It has a sardonic and tongue-in-cheek tone throughout. A newspaper article that comes out after the protagonist goes mad and runs away from home states, |\\\" What we would like to ask, however, is not \\\"What is the name of Mr. Oshino's malady?\\\" but rather \\\"What is Mr. Oshino's responsibility to his wife?\\\" Like an unblemished golden jar, our glorious National Essence stands upon a foundation of belief in the family. We need not ask, then, how grave the responsibilities of the head of any one family might be. Does the head of a family have the right to go mad any time he feels like it? To this question we must offer a resounding \\\"No!\\\" |Imagine what would happen if the husbands of the world suddenly acquired the right to go mad. All, without exception, would leave their families behind for a happy life of song on the road, or wandering over hill and dale, or being kept well fed and clothed in an insane asylum. Then our 1,000-year-old belief in the family \\u2014 our very pride in the eyes of the world \\u2014 could not fail to collapse. We are not, of course, urging that Mr. Oshino be treated harshly. We must, however, loudly beat the drum to condemn his rash crime of having gone mad. No, let this not be limited to Mr. Oshino's crime alone. We must also condemn the utter misfeasance of successive administrations for having neglected our urgent need for a law prohibiting insanity.\\\"|I did not enjoy the supposed autobiographical section called \\\"Akutagawa's Own Story\\\" as much as I did his fiction. They had their moments, but were overall quite tedious to read.|Daidoji Shinsuke explores his childhood and school, with the narrator being a self-proclaimed intellectual. \\\"Death Register\\\" talks about his estranged, insane mother, an elder sister he never got to know, and his father who relinquished him as a baby. \\\"The Life of a Stupid Man,\\\" and \\\"Spinning Gears\\\" both show Akutagawa probing the meaning of the life he has led to that point, and moving ever closer to death. |* |Notes for myself|\\u2022 |Akutagawa's mental illnesses and their impact on his work|\\\"We will never know for certain whether the neuroses from which he suffered later in life were caused by hereditary factors, mental instability, or his latent fears, but sickness of mind casts a heavy shadow on the late stories and would end up taking his life. Surely it would be no exaggeration to say that writing these late works effectively shortened his life, but it is also true that he was unable to find a way to go on living as a writer without writing works of this nature-and once he could no longer live as a writer, his life would cease to have meaning. It well could be that Akutagawa had to turn to the world of storytelling and technique in order to find refuge from his dark heredity. Rather than face the real world, so full of terror and pain, he might have transported himself mind and body into another world in hopes of finding a kind of salvation in its fictionality.\\\"|\\u2022|Akutagawa's position in Japanese literary history, as given by Murakami| \\\"Perhaps the true reason that Akutagawa Ryunosuke continues to be read and admired today as a \\\"national writer\\\" lies in this in the realization and determination that effectively pushed him into a dead end. He started out as one of the chosen few: a Japanese intellectual with a consciousness torn between the West and Japan's traditional culture, in the border regions of which he succeeded in erecting a uniquely vigorous world of story. As he matured, he attempted to fuse the two different cultures inside himself at a higher level. He attempted structurally to combine the distinctively Japanese style of the I-novel with his own elegant fictional method. He hoped, in other words, to pioneer a newer, more uniquely Japanese form of serious literature. But this would have required a strenuous, long-term effort that his hypersensitive nerves and delicate con- stitution could not sustain. Pursued by the dark visions that crawled out of the gloom, he would finally despair and cut his life short. Akutagawa's terrible suicide administered a great shock to the minds of his contemporaries. It signaled both the defeat of a member of the intellectual elite and a major turning point in history.|Many Japanese would see in the death of this one writer the triumph, the aestheticism, the anguish, and the unavoidable downfall of the Taish\\u014d Period's cultivated elite. His individual declaration of defeat also became a signpost on the road of history leading to the tragedy of the Second World War. In the period just before and after his death, the flower of democracy that had bloomed with such promise in the Taisho Period simply shriveled and died. Soon the boots of the military would resound everywhere. The writer Akutagawa Ryunosuke stands as an illuminating presence in the history of Japanese literature, a symbol of his age's brief glory and quiet defeat.\\\"|\\u2022|The role of a writer in the contemporary globalized world|\\\"Today, when the world is growing ever smaller through the spectacular development of the Internet and the increasingly rapid flow of economic interchange, we find ourselves in a pressing situation whereby, like it or not, our very survival depends on our ability to exchange cultural methodologies on an equivalent basis. To turn toward a stance of national exclusivity, regionalism, or fundamentalism in which nations become isolated politically, economically, culturally, or religiously could bring about unimaginable dangers on a worldwide scale. If only in that sense, we novelists and other creative individuals must simultaneously broadcast our cultural messages outward and be flexible receptors of what comes to us from abroad. Even as we unwaveringly preserve our own identity, we must exchange that which can be exchanged and understand that which can be mutually understood. Our role is perfectly clear.\\\" It\\u2019s hard to review something like Ry\\u016bnosuke Akutagawa\\u2019s | Rash\\u014dmon and Seventeen Other Stories|: it\\u2019s too complex, too often inducing a |\\u201cWhat was that I read?\\u201d|, too deep, and yet approachable, very readable. |I found this book by chance while surfing Goodreads, and was immediately attracted by | Rash\\u014dmon|, since I am a fan of Kurosawa\\u2019s, and am all admiration for that particular film (the plot of which, ironically, draws more from Akutagawa\\u2019s |In the Bamboo Grove| than it does from | Rash\\u014dmon| itself). I bought the book and told myself that I\\u2019d read it slowly, one short story at a time\\u2014and found myself caught like a fly in a spider\\u2019s web. I ended up reading most of this book in long stretches, until my eyes hurt. |The eighteen stories are very diverse in nature: there are ghosts here, and dragons. There is hell, both somewhat distant, seen through the benevolent eyes of the Sakyamuni in |The Spider Thread|, |and| close, horrifying, macabre\\u2014as in |Hell Screen|. There are tales of a Japan torn between tradition and modernity, of battles between Christianity and older, local beliefs. There are battles, too, between man and man, and\\u2014most forcibly, most searingly, the stories of man\\u2019s battles with himself. The latter are brought most vividly (and disturbingly) to life in the last section of the book, which brings together six autobiographical stories by Akutagawa. |As I progressed through this book, I went through a range of emotions. I laughed at the quirky humour in |The Nose, Dragon: The Old Potter\\u2019s Tale| and |Green Onions|. I shivered at the cruelty of |Hell Screen|. And I couldn\\u2019t help but wonder how much of |Spinning Gears| (which was published posthumously, after Akutagawa killed himself in 1927) was real, and how much was not. |This is a brilliant book. It\\u2019s rich, textured, detailed. The imagery is often breathtaking (\\u201c|She had a radiant face, like the morning sun on a thin sheet of ice\\u201d|), and the layers are fascinating, peeling away from the mundane, even comical, to the wryly profound. As an example: |\\u201dHe put a cigarette in his mouth and was striking a match when he collapsed face-down on his desk and died. It was a truly disappointing way to die. Fortunately, however, society rarely offers critical comment regarding the way a person dies. The way a person lives is what evokes criticism|.\\u201d|The translator, Jay Rubin, also provides useful notes on stories and their elements, which help in a better understanding of the story (especially for someone not familiar with Japan and its culture). In addition, there\\u2019s a brief but good biography of Akutagawa, and a superb introduction by Haruki Murakami. I would advise reading all of these, besides the stories that comprise the book: they help get a better insight into the author, and so add to the experience. |I ended this book feeling both oddly deflated |and| inspired. As a writer, I can\\u2019t help but be inspired by writing of such stature. As a writer, too, I can\\u2019t help but feel that I cannot possibly ever write as brilliantly as this. Not a book I am going to forget in a hurry, if ever.  I first came by Ry\\u016bnosuke Akutagawa via Akira Kurosawa\\u2019s 1950 film |Rash\\u014dmon|. It\\u2019s an adaptation of two short stories within this collection: \\u201cIn a Bamboo Grove\\u201d and \\u201cRash\\u014dmon\\u201d (though Kurosawa adapted the former and simply took the name of the latter and used it as a framing device). It\\u2019s one of my favorite Kurosawa films, and so I knew I\\u2019d like to check out the source material at some point. I\\u2019m glad I did, because there are some really good stories here and it\\u2019s an overall well-rounded anthology.|This collection is divided into four sections: A World in Decay, Under the Sword, Modern Tragicomedy, and Akutagawa's Own Story. Akutagawa crosses genres throughout these stories--from comedy to drama to autobiography to Jidaigeki to the Gothic--and a lot of them work out quite well. I\\u2019m a particular fan of \\u201cIn a Bamboo Grove,\\u201d \\u201cHell Screen,\\u201d \\u201cThe Nose,\\u201d \\u201cThe Spider Thread,\\u201d and \\u201cGreen Onions.\\u201d The autobiographical stories in the last section, while at times quite fascinating in learning about Akutagawa\\u2019s inner turmoil, don\\u2019t read as well as the previous stories; they\\u2019re interesting and informational, but they\\u2019re ultimately a little hard to get into and not as entertaining as the previous stories.|Akutagawa is a great writer. He oftentimes has some slick and inviting prose, which makes for easy and enjoyable reading. His well-placed comedic touches were surprising too. However, if you aren\\u2019t that educated on Japanese history and geography, like me, then you may struggle a bit with the references. There are extremely helpful note indications throughout, but that means flipping to the back of the book, which does disrupt the flow of reading. I\\u2019d definitely recommend this collection, but some might want to proceed with caution. This collection of short stories had no discernable connection or theme throughout. The stories were pretty different: some were fantastical/fairytale-like, with spirits and gods etc.; others were realistic historical fiction. The realistic ones were also pretty varied: some featured real historical figures, like poets, artists and politicians; others were populated by completely fictional characters. Some were set in ancient times, some in medieval, some in XVII, XVIII, XIX centuries. |Jumping between these entirely different tones and settings felt jarring|.|There were a |few stories I thought were brilliant|, moving or enjoyable. One of them, in particular, was about |Matsuo Bash\\u014d|, made me want to pick up a collection of his haikus. |But for at least a |half of the book or more, I was bored and struggled| through unknown words, things and concepts, spirits and historical figures which carried no meaning for me, character/plot arcs that I didn't get.\",\n          \"I had a predisposition to like this, as I enjoy Sir Walter Scott, and I also read and enjoyed Maturin's \\\"Melmoth the Wanderer\\\" some years ago. In fact, this was such enjoyable escapism that I think I got more pleasure from it than any other book I've read this year so far. It helps that I have always felt more at home in the 13th century than the 21st. This is a magnificent blend of Gothic fantasy: battles, jousts, sieges, damsels in distress, wise hermits, evil witches, corrupt ecclesiastics - even werewolves...with plenty of comedy to leaven the horror, and some bromance to leaven the courtly love of knights for maidens. Some of the physical description, such as of the bandit castle by the sea, left me vertiginously intoxicated. I was there, torchlight flickering as I climbed the stone spiral staircase, damp exhalations from the dungeons beneath, looking out over the battlements on a wild and stormy sea under the star crossed sky...|Are there faults? Only if you dislike this sort of thing. If you know nothing of the historical background, are not familiar with the Bible, and have no Latin, then it would be very confusing. One of the comic themes is the relationship between two worldly prelates, the battle-axe-wielding Bishop of Toulouse and the wine-bibbing Abbot of Normoutier. The bishop's disdain for the latter is founded on the Abbot's frequent mangling of his Latin quips and descent into \\\"dog\\\" Latin. I think I missed a lot of the wittier and more abstruse puns, but then as a schoolboy my Latin compositions were often disfigured by my Latin master drawing a lamppost in the margin of my exercise book, signifying that my efforts were mere \\\"dog\\\" Latin themselves. |Nevertheless this is a tightly plotted page-turner and I was sorry when it came to an end.

The ending is conventional in that we get happy marriages all round, but perhaps not so conventional in that the context is one of happy ecumenism and the healing of apparently irreconcilable religious difference through the solvent of love and friendship.

It is fast-paced, sweet-tempered, open-hearted, a golden book in many ways \\u2013 a paean to youth, to a future brimming with possibility, to a present that is lived vibrantly and joyfully. It is also about selling out, junkies, prostitution, and race wars. How can this be? I suppose it is all about point of view, and the protagonist\\u2019s perspective is the embodiment of Live Now and Love It. This is one of those rare novels that make the reader feel even more alive by reading it. The enthusiasm of its narrator was equaled by my enthusiasm of the world that MacInnes plunges us into headfirst. It depicts, it mocks, it leaps forward, it grabs your hand and carries you along.|I was young once, gosh, just a decade or so ago. I lived a life full of punks, hippies, goths, ravers, djs, fags, dykes, trans girls & guys, straight guys who made out with other guys and straight girls who were angry and ardent feminists, vegetarians and vegans, girls who stripped for cash in dives and guys who waved their hard-ons for free in print, fighters and peacemakers, guys who carved symbols on their bodies and girls who dressed like vampire princesses; we lived in junked-out flats filled with too many people, we shared clothes and went on road trips and had neverending parties and made protests against the government and danced all night and consumed amazing amounts of booze and drugs and sex and live music. I read Absolute Beginners during that period, and one of the best things about this novel was that it felt completely real and true to me, despite the difference in social scenes that were separated by decades, by an ocean. It showed the true diversity available to people in their late teens, in their 20s; it illustrated \\u2013 and so nonchalantly \\u2013 values that were not just held dear, but were unspoken, values that defied the middle class and that were simply assumed to be shared by everyone we knew. To read oneself and one\\u2019s peers in a novel written in 1958 is something special, something wonderfully moving to contemplate, even many years later.|What lifts Absolute Beginners above the idea that life for the young and unencumbered can be a great time, a fun carnival, is its complete awareness that this is also rather an illusion, and a crushingly temporary one at that. So many wonderful things can happen, so much excitement \\u2013 and yet the world around this world still exists to be fought against. For me and my friends, that world to rail against did not just include asshole yuppies who came to our neighborhoods from time to time, it included police brutality, the WTO, the wars abroad. In Absolute Beginners, that world above includes race warfare. \\\"Race\\\" is clearly interwoven throughout the narrative, and yet it is one of so many things that the narrator is aware of, just one facet of the world that the narrator comments on... the reader could almost lose sight of it. But race and racism are there the entire time and slowly but surely become the whole point; by the end, the reader and the protagonist see how fragile a life full of living can be when the world is singling out his peers for destruction, and those peers are turning to him for alliance. The protagonist chooses, and chooses well. But it marks an ending of sorts, an ending of an attitude and a lifestyle, and the beginning of an understanding that no matter what he and his peers have built, he lives in the world still, as does everyone, and that world is one of both wonder and horror. One of the reasons I picked up |Absolute Beginners| again was because of historian Dominic Sandbrook's daft grudge against Colin Macinnes (in | |Never Had It So Good| |). I last attempted it in my teens. It had been a slowish read \\u2013 proved to be the same this time round \\u2013 and was easy to give up on back then because the library copy was a horrible mouldy one. |Now, the vintage atmosphere and detail in the story was way more interesting so I hung around to savour that (when younger I'd filed this era as being 'before anything was cool'), noticing differences from the film musical, and processing the late 1950s slang. Plenty of 60s slang is still immediately familiar yet this stuff from only 5-10 years earlier, not immortalised in pop culture, can require a moment's thought to work out. These characters are the cool kids of my parents' generation, yet they are so different it reminded me how facile the idea of generation=social attitude can be. (One of the good points Sandbrook makes is that most people of this era, even the younger ones, weren't mods, hippies or their rock 'n' roll precursors, they were hardworking squares.) |There's something artificial about the way the main character loves the term \\u201cteenager\\u201d (as beloved of the media then as \\u201chipster\\u201d has been for the last few years, though back then there was more fear and real disapproval, rather than the contemporary eye-rolling). He likes defining what it means to be a teenager \\u2013 it's a culture at least as much as an age, squares aren't really teenagers \\u2013 and it's not that different from The Who's 'My Generation', by the time of whose release the narrator and his mates might (if they weren't still pop-culture purveyors) be boring oldsters. The over-consciousness of cultural definitions works in a way because he's one of those entrepreneurial kids who's interested in talking to the media and getting noticed by the movers and shakers (in an 80s or 90s setting he'd be a DJ / party planner, here he's a photographer, proto-|Blow-Up|) but it's also a reminder that |Absolute Beginners| was written by a champagne socialist easily old enough to be the protagonist's dad. Some of the press evidently loved it (a quote on the back from |Harpers & Queen| says \\\"Prose as sharp as a pair of Italian slacks and vivid as a pair of pink socks\\\", |The Sunday Times|: \\\"The cult novel of the year.\\\"). But I'd love to know what the real teenagers of the day thought of this book... Was everything in it so five years ago by the time they ever saw a copy? (By the 80s, presumably re-reviewing in the light of the film, the |NME| says \\\"Macinnes caught it first - and best\\\"; and Paul Weller, just born when it was published, \\\"a book of inspiration.\\\")|Some reviewers are critical of the way black, Jewish or gay people are described by the narrator. There's an element of positive stereotyping, complimentary or neutral description with frequent reference to some of the narrator's friends' background (how lively a friend's Jewish household is compared with his English one, there are white girls who fancy black men apparently because of sexual stereotypes, that sort of thing). But they have personalities too, and the narrator is way more inclusive and accepting than most of his contemporaries, even prepared to get injured defending his mates during the Notting Hill race riots. His way of speaking is what, over decades, evolved into the contemporary attitudes that mean it isn't okay to say the same things now. Such critics tend to dislike arguments for historical context, but if ever there was a good one for those people cutting a text some slack, it's with this book. |I'm kind of surprised to see so many reviews on here, and quite good ones, for |Absolute Beginners|; I'd had the impression its reputation was fading. Seems that inclusion in |1001 Books To Read Before You Die| has boosted it a bit. For my part I'd recommend it mostly for people interested in the social & cultural history, and for those who like some background to their vintage clothes/film/music habit.  A rather entertaining novel which evokes the emerging youth culture in Great Britain in the 1950s. An unnamed 18-year-old story teller searches for his own way in life, but obviously wrestles with the classic social conventions. The last quarter the book is more a description of the growing minority problem, including racial riots. The city of London shines through the book, and the author clearly shows his love for that city. Of course, this radiates the atmosphere of the times it was published (1959), with quite a few pages full of slang, but at the same time it has something refreshing. A plus also is the engaging style of MacInnis, with some razor-edge dialogues. Fun! Controversial. Interesting!|And you get to have the Bowie song in your head the entire time.

A good read and did well to portray the time and place but not the classic I was expecting. Definitely worth a read though. To be honest, this book was more interesting to me for its historical value than for anything contained in the story. Absolute Beginners' narrator felt like something of a dull archetype \\u2013 the arrogant late-teenager convinced he knows more than those around him, and unaware of his own failings. | Perhaps it was more of a novelty in 1958, when it was written. Which brings me to what I thought was most intriguing about the novel. To me at least, it read for all the world like the anachronistic work of someone writing in much more recent times about how they would have imagined the late 1950s to be. The passing references to running like Dr Roger Bannister or driving away from a riot like Fangio could so easily have been clumsy attempts to remind the reader that the story is taking place in a particular historical setting. But more than that, the anti-racist politics of the latter part of the novel, set against the background of the 1958 Notting Hill race riots, read to me like a modern liberal's wish fulfilment of what a white liberal kid in the late 50s might have made of it (though such an author would probably have refrained from having his narrator use the term 'Spade' to describe the black characters. MacInnes was, in this respect at least ahead of his time. Perhaps the more remarkable for the fact that he was already about the same age as the narrator's father and maybe this goes some way to explain another of the book's oddities \\u2013 the narrator's idiolect and use of slang terms I've never really encountered anywhere else. Not being old enough to judge myself, I might be doing MacInnes a disservice, but I couldn't help thinking of Anthony Burgess' made up youth argot from A Clockwork Orange. An moderately interesting diversion, which I'd picked up after hearing Andy Miller praising it on Little Atoms, but nothing more. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this. It's the first book of the year and the first book I had to read for this semester of university (for my post-1945 literature class) and it definitely sets the tone for a good year of reading.|It was way funnier than I expected and I really enjoyed the episodic element of the story. We basically follow the main character who is a young photograph in 1958's London through 4 different days in 4 different months of the year. The main character's narrative voice is very unique and it reminded me a lot of Alex from the Clockwork Orange in the sense that both characters invent their own slang and language through which they see and describe their world. The book is divided in four parts and every part is focused on one day. Even though at first the story seems to be a simple romance, it progressively gets more and more complicated as the author is getting closer to the events of the Notting Hill race riots in September of 1958. There is a strong element of diversity in the characters, we have black people, Indians, homosexuals, lesbians and more. MacInnes really strives to inform the reader of his time and bring to him a new understanding of the culture of these minorities, different from the way they were represented in the media.  A long summer in the London of the late fifties is the setting, as the nameless eighteen year old protagonist makes his living taking pornographic photographs in the few gaps in his hectic social life spent on his Vespa and in the coffee bars and jazz clubs. As the months pass he experiences friendship, betrayal, love and death with a motley cast of friends known by their nicknames, jobs or fashion sense; the deranged Wizard, the rentboy the Fabulous Hoplite, Mr Cool, the Misery Kid, Crepe Suzette and Ed the Ted. |There is the semblance of a plot, but this is driven by its protagonist, in whose character the reader is soon engrossed by, a teenager full of innocence looking at injustices around him, and deciding to act; particularly with regard to race, and the riots of the time. |Its about growing up, becoming wiser and yet remaining young and fearless, looking sharper and staying one step ahead of the crowd.|The book is rich in social history, with some wonderful descriptions of the city and the jazz of the day. As the 60s approach its the birth of the Mod scene, and quite inspirational.  I always had a soft spot for Julien Temple's film |Absolute Beginners|. I guess it was a bit overly ambitious to make a modern musical based on a 1958 novella, but I am grateful for the attempt. It produced a beautiful soundtrack featuring songs from Smiley Culture and the Style Council; wonderful vignettes from David Bowie (tap-dancing across a giant typewriter), Ray Davies, and Sade; and an opening sequence of black and white photographs from 1950s London which are nostalgic and heartbreaking to watch. And where did he get that great opening shot of Piccadilly Circus?!|I guess that's the real attraction of the book. It's an ode to a city that the narrator loves so much, it nearly breaks his heart. Colin MacInnes is keenly aware that he is writing about a time that is already in the past, that is already gone, that he already feels the ache of loss for. Basho might sum it up as \\\"Sitting in London, I miss London.\\\" The city as we imagine it isn't the reality and maybe that's what it means to be a teenager: that process of discovering that how you think the world should be isn't what it actually is. With that lesson, this is a coming-of-age novel in the spirit of Catcher in the Rye -- the love of place and childhood innocence that inevitably slips away.|The movie, for a musical, did capture a lot more in the book than I would have expected, but it certainly borrowed most heavily from the first and last chapters: meeting all of the narrator's Soho characters and the 1958 riots: setting and plot, and some rather slick dialogue. But being a musical, the movie is a bit shallow in character. The novel gives us two middle chapters which the movie largely ignores, but gives readers an insight into the inner thoughts and feelings of the narrator. The relationship of the narrator to his family and his father in particular is deeply touching. Despite the narrator's apathetic attitude to anything of seriousness and his dismissive attitude toward old-timers, past and present catches up with him.|This book has a special place in my heart and always will. I adore meeting all the characters in the narrator's life, and 1958 London certainly looks wild and fun, but the author's injection of pathos gives this cult novel an authenticity that makes it universal. (Although, I still feel I need a hip chat dictionary.) |Bonus takeaway: Hipsters seem even more derivative after this novel. On the plus side I could still remember whole scenes from this work although it has been at least twenty years since I last read it. The negative is that it hasn't aged well. It rings as true as a lead pound coin. The author's attempt to approximate working class and youth cultural speech is cringe worthy and patronising. The reality was that McInnes was from a middle-class background and grew up in pre-war colonial Australia long before the concept of the teenager as an entity existed. He vacillates between regurgitating media reports about the teenage phenomenon and preaching liberal-left propaganda. The cast of stereotypical characters are moved around a cardboard cut-out set reminiscent of an Edwardian child's toy theatre. As Colin points out to his older brother,|\\u2018In those days, it seems, you were just an overgrown boy, or an under-grown man, life didn\\u2019t seem to cater anything whatever else between.\\u2019|His generation, however, were not just following their parents or becoming father or mother clones. They were the first adolescent group to have money, their own clothes, and the first adolescent group to consider themselves \\u2018teenagers\\u2019. They were starting out from scratch, making it up as the went along. They weren\\u2019t just beginners in the world of adults. They were absolute beginners.| I am sure that the plot is that great or the ending that satisfying, but the whole thing is so vibrant that it just carried me along. I loved it.  Back in 1999 I watched a film called Quadrophenia, in which depicts the life of a mod: The clothes he buys, the music he listens to, the love for Vespas and the constant showdowns with rockers. I thought it was quite original ( I knew it was based of a rock opera) Now that I have read Absolute beginners I am certain that this book was clearly an influence.|The plot is about the life of a mod. It also focuses on the lifestyle. However, it is much more than that. For starters there are a lot of passages about the freedom that youth brings and how older generations do not understand them. The main character is a jazz loving 19 year old, just ready to enter his twenties and we get his views on how society looks in his eyes, the absolute beginners being the name he calls his generation. I guess one could call this book an early YA novel.|Absolute Beginners is a love letter to London: but not only the romantic aspect. Like Last Exit to Brooklyn, Macinnes mentions people who usually do not feature in books. Thus we get portrayals of drug addicts, black communities and the London gay scene. The final section on the book is a loose commentary on the immigrants which entered London during that time.|Did I like the book? Although I found it interesting, I didn\\u2019t gel with the narration style plus I did find it overlong, the first section could have easily been shorter. I do know that the book has an ardent following and is somewhat a cult classic. Lately I've been into mid-century books narrated by teenagers. While I was traveling in London a couple of weeks ago, I started reading |Absolute Beginners| about 1958 Notting Hill in the run-up to the race riots. Now I'm reading Jos\\u00e9 Agust\\u00edn's |La Tumba|, which was published in 1964 and follows a rebellious, literary teenager as he attempts to navigate the stiff, adult world of 1960s Mexico City. |I realized why I'm finding these books appealing when I watched the |recent documentary on JD Salinger|, author of perhaps the most famous midcentury book narrated by a teenager, |The Catcher in the Rye|. All teenagers feel alienated from adult society \\u2014 mostly because they refuse to succumb to the phoniness of it all. In order to become successful in life, you must accept a level of phoniness. You must learn to refrain from expressing certain opinions. You must master the art of sycophancy and tactical deference. Adult social interaction is, |in the words of Irving Goffman|, \\\"theatrical performance.\\\" |But teenagers aren't yet invested enough in their careers or communities to succumb to the phoniness. And so, refreshingly, they rebel against it. Teenage protagonists of novels are so appealing because, despite their insecurity and inexperience, they are authentic. They allow us to engage in the fantasy of doing and saying what we merely think because we're afraid of upset the theatrical performance of polite society.|Throughout my week in London, I became increasingly attached to the nameless, teenage narrator. |Absolute Beginners| is the British equivalent of beatnik literature. But instead of depicting the jeans-and-t-shirt-wearing literary beats of the US, we're entreated to a ragtag cast of |mods| and |teddy boys|, the two rival youth subcultures of post-war London. The novel depicts youth culture in London through the eyes of a precocious, empathetic teenager in the run-up to the |1958 Notting Hill race riots|. |The book is great social documentary of London's complicated multicultural coming of age through the eyes of a narrator's personal coming of age. It's also excellent fiction with a Kerouac-like unorthodoxy of prose. If you're interested in learning more about the 1958 race riots, BBC as a good |overview|, and |Stasy Adams| and |Nick Bentley| have written academic pieces on MacInnes's portrayal of 1950s London in his fiction. \\u201cNow, you can think what you like about the art of jazz \\u2013 quite frankly, I don\\u2019t really care what you think, because jazz is a thing so wonderful that if anybody doesn\\u2019t rave about it, all you can feel for them is pity: not that I\\u2019m making out I really understand it all \\u2013 I mean, certain LPs leave me speechless.\\u201d |\\u2015 Absolute Beginners|Colin MacInnes' novel \\\"Absolute Beginners\\\" (1959) is a wide-lens view of pre-Beatlemania London, with characters, images and ideas that remain pop fixtures: stylish, jazz-loving Mods; leather-clad, rock-loving Teddy Boys; the ascendancy of the teenager with increased income and diminished responsibility; and an atmosphere of combustible youth culture reacting to WWII-era morals.|\\\"Absolute Beginners\\\" is a remarkable period artifact for those reasons alone, but its literary qualities will surprise many readers looking for the cult novel that profoundly influenced Paul Weller. MacInnes' novel is energetic, lyrical and often brilliantly written. With its combination of cynical, stylized observation and dreamlike panoramas, \\\"Absolute Beginners\\\" feels like J.D. Salinger's \\\"Catcher in the Rye\\\" crossed with C\\u00e9line's \\\"Journey to the End of the Night\\\" and \\\"Death on the Installment Plan.\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0|The novel is less a plotted tale than a shifting, mildly surreal journey across London and its outskirts. Divided into four chapters, each section captures the events of a single day over separate months in 1958. The unnamed 18-year old narrator creates the impression of a \\\"Lord of the Flies\\\" social experiment in reverse, where teenagers have created a separate, superior civilization of freedom and literate sophistication. Living independently as a photographer in a diverse West End neighborhood, he encounters a range of colorful characters: the \\\"ponce\\\" (pimp) Wiz, the biracial Mr. Cool, the lesbian Big Jill, the violent and illiterate Ed the Ted, and his unrequited love \\\"Cr\\u00eape\\\" Suzette. The key conflicts are the threat of a race riot, the narrator's complex love for Suzette, whom he finds in a mariage blanc with an older man, and the sad expectation that youth's fleeting, ecstatic moment will soon fade.|With its unremitting imagery and stylized wordplay, \\\"Absolute Beginners\\\" is probably best read in a short immersive burst where its unique atmosphere can be savored before its novelty fades. Readers willing to surrender to its rhythms will discover an oblique, charged reality, a dreamily evocative Swinging London of the mind. Julien Temple's 1986 musical film adaptation, more \\\"Newsies\\\" than C\\u00e9line, suggests the challenges of filming MacInnes' vision. The participation of David Bowie and Ray Davies confirms its lasting influence, but it remains a unique, unrepeatable artifact. I had to take some time to organise my thoughts on this. It's difficult to assess exactly what I think of a book that is so firmly set in and attached to a particular time and place. A further problem is that the time is a couple of decades before I was born and the place is the opposite side of the country. As a result, I have no idea if the events or the narration of |Absolute Beginners| are in any way authentic. I also don't really care. The narration really reminded me of Anthony Burgess's |A Clockwork Orange|, not only because both books are narrated by disaffected youths but because there's also a similar rhythm and feel to it.|I found the first half of the book less interesting than the last. While I enjoyed bouncing around the London mod scene, particularly the nicknames and commentary on the other characters, I never felt very invested in the narrator's on/off relationship with Suze and really didn't feel that there was much tension in it. The sections I enjoyed the most were the home visits with his family and the race riots that conclude the story. I felt that his conversations with his mother and father really showed the generational disconnect without being overly dramatic or cliched. Both the family and race riot sections are when the prose comes out of the setting and moves onto more universal themes. |The race riot deserves its own special paragraph. This is the part of the book that I felt was truly great. The simmering tension that we feel before things start to get violent conjured up images from Spike Lee's masterful |Do the Right Thing|. Again we see themes and issues raised that are as relevant today as they've ever been. In particular, the way that racial tensions are exploited by tabloid media. Although the media featured here is print, today's TV news is every bit as bad and the tabloids are still what they've always been. The government and police are also criticised for their ineffectiveness, either through a lack of will or a lack of ability. The more things change... It\\u2019s London in 1958, and the narrator of Colin MacInnes\\u2019s novel is living in what seems to be a new-minted teenage paradise, where teens, for the first time, have money to spend and the freedom to spend. It\\u2019s a world where all races, creeds and levels of society mix, a world where the (never named) narrator feels totally at home \\u2014 the only cloud on the horizon being that the love of his love, Suze, has agreed to marry her homosexual boss as a front (homosexuality being illegal at the time). The narrator spends most of the first half of the book wandering round London, talking to Teddy boys, pimps, TV personalities, pop stars, jazz cats, fellow teens and advertising executives \\u2014 they all seem to know him, and many owe him a favour or two. Everything\\u2019s looking up.|But, no, it isn\\u2019t. 1958 was the year of some infamous race riots, and MacInnes\\u2019s narrator lives right in the middle of where they\\u2019re brewing. Also, his dad may be dying.|It\\u2019s a novel that seeks to capture the brave new world of its time, when life for its young narrator seems full of nothing but possibility, only to be suddenly dashed as he becomes thoroughly disgusted with the intolerance, violence, and sheer complacency his fellow human beings are capable of. It\\u2019s written in a rather odd style \\u2014 I\\u2019m not sure if teenagers actually spoke in this peculiar mix of mock-formality and jazz-like improvisation (it reminded me most of all of Anthony Burgess\\u2019s invented patois for |A Clockwork Orange|). Here\\u2019s a sample:|\\u2018Hail, squire,\\u2019 I said. \\u2018Long time no see. How is you are we? Won\\u2019t you say tell?\\u2019|Moments of insight, moments of poetry, moments of confusion. A slice of life shot through with bursts of teenage outrage and human compassion. Nice and short, too. I started reading this novel with bad intentions. I wanted to laugh at it. For some reason I assumed it was going to be corny, poorly written and absurdly naive... As it happens, it |does| contain some language that has dated in such a way that it brings a smile to the lips of the modern reader, but it's simply not possible to read this book right through with an ironic smirk. It's just too good, too exuberant, too smart, too accomplished, and the issues it raises are acutely appropriate for our own age.|The single quality about it that impressed me the most is the relative sophistication of the narrator in the essential political, cultural and social aspects of London life. Bear in mind that this is the 1950s. The narrator's attitudes are more advanced than those of the average person that I remember in my childhood back in the 1970s; and his style is a damn sight sharper. This book has changed my view of what life was like in '50s Britain. It wasn't |necessarily| all grey and bland... I wanted to read Absolute Beginners because of its ties to the development of Mod culture. I was expecting to get a glimpse into late 1950s British youth culture, but the book explores a whole lot more than that. I found the first 10 pages or so a little hard going until I got my head around the rhythm of the speech patterns, but once I was used to it and sorted out a few of the slang words it made for easy reading. |The first person narration really gives you a really personal look into the life of a main character with a very distinctive voice in quite a unique time culturally. At the same time MacInnes deftly weaves the bigger social issues of race, class, and sexual orientation into this very personal story, not unlike the way Christopher Isherwood captured 1930s Germany in his Berlin Novels.|Absolute Beginner's is not only a fascinating look into 1950s British youth culture, but British culture as whole just before the dawn of the far more documented 1960s. An interesting, thought provoking, witty novel set in London in 1958 and written in the first person from the perspective of an eighteen year old white teenage boy. He is a free lance photographer living in an apartment block. He is very social, mixing with a variety of individuals. He describes the smoky jazz clubs of Soho, the coffee bars of Notting Hill, his relationships with his girlfriend Suzette, his mother, father, siblings and friends.|I found the last fifty pages of the novel particularly interesting as he vividly describes the beginnings of the Notting Hill racial disturbances / riots from the perspective of a white teenager.|A worthwhile, rewarding reading experience. This book was first published in 1959. From BBC Radio 4 - Book at Bedtime:|Colin MacInnes's cult classic about teenagers, style and racial tension in 1950s London A lively story and thought-provoking at times. The copious slang reminded me of A Clockwork Orange. I rate it a four-minus.  This is the second book I read for the books1001 LiveJournal book club community. It was not one I would have picked up to read on my own, and probably wouldn't otherwise have finished even if I did start reading it. The reason is that I found the language difficult to follow, being full of slang and dialect that I am unfamiliar with. Also, after the first hundred pages or so, I realized that nothing was really going to happen. This book is more a portrait of a lifestyle, or of a generation, than a plotty story. Yes, there are some story arcs and character development, but they do not really generate a sense of tension or movement in the book. |Having said that, I was deeply impressed by the author's style of writing, by his use of vocabulary and image-building. I felt that I was there, in London of the 1950s, and was completely infected by the malaise, helplessness, yet hopefulness of the main character and his acquaintances. |======|And here is the more extensive review I posted on books1001:|Title: Absolute Beginners|Author: Colin MacInnes|Publication date: First published 1959, this edition re-issued 1986 by Penguin Books|# of pages: 226|Source: Bought used through Amazon.de (3 Euros + 3 Euros shipping)|Summary/Back of the book: It was the fag-end of a London summer in the fifties and change simmered below the surface... The young and the restless -- the Absolute Beginners -- were busy creating a new world of cool music, coffee bars and freer love, as different from Mrs Dale and traditional England's green and pleasant land as they dared to make it. Sharp, pungent, filled with the dreams and danger of city life, Absolute Beginners is now a brilliant film.|My review: The Great Gatsby, meet After Hours (1985 Scorsese film). Briefly: This is a book I wouldn't have picked up on my own, but I feel enriched after having read it.|There's not much plot: An 18-year-old Londoner who makes a living taking pornographic photographs wanders around the city, meeting up with various movers, shakers, pimps, prostitutes, and representatives of pretty much every disadvantaged and advantaged minority of his acquaintance. There are Jews, blacks, and Sikhs, lesbians and gays, white supremacists, gang bangers, television personalities, newspapermen and -women, socialites, songwriters, a diplomat, half-siblings, dysfunctional family members, an advertising executive, and lots and lots of jazz aficionados. And of course the requisite love interest, who is unhappily married to a gay man old enough to be her father.|The book consists mainly of the protagonist (who is never named) bouncing from one encounter to the next, partly driven by his need to hustle up some business and partly through sheer chance and the fact that he seems to know everyone who's anyone, and most of the people who aren't as well. The only loose plot threads that I could pick out were our boy's puppy-love pursuit of Suzette, and the slowly building racial conflict that explodes in the last section. I don't want to make it seem like the book is about race or class conflict, though; at least it didn't come across that way to me. It was more (again, to me at least) about the disconnection and rootlessness of the post-war generation.|There is so much that could be analyzed in this book, but I'll just touch on one point which I think illustrates this underlying theme. That is the lack of names for the characters. Not only the narrator, but many of his acquaintances are only referred to by various nicknames such as The Wizard, Call-me-Cobber, the ex-Deb, and Mr Cool. It is as if the narrator has rejected the names (and thus the roles) assigned to them by their parents, as representatives of the previous generation, and they are re-inventing themselves, or seeking their own identities and by doing so, re-defining the world itself.|Moving on to the other main point I wanted to discuss, I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with the style in which this book was written. This is the love part:|\\\"Up out in Pimlico, the old, old city raised her bashed grey head again, like she was ashamed of her modern daughter down by the river, and I went up the streets of dark purple and vomit green, all set at angles like ham sandwiches...\\\"|The imagery is pure poetry, and never degrades into cliche. I was mesmerized by the descriptions, and surprised time and again by the new and imaginative ways in which the author put words together to create an emotional impression.|But this is the hate part: |'And why, Ed,' I said, 'have you moved darn ear?'|'Cos me Ma as,' he said. 'She's bin re-owsed.'| |I find reading dialect tiresome, and especially as an American, it's difficult to figure out.|or:|And straining up the Portobello road, I passed a crocodile of infants, and among them a number of little Spadelets, and I noticed, not for the first time, how, in the underground movement of the juveniles, they hadn't been educated up yet to the colour thing.|This is an example of the pervasiveness of slang expressions; it took me a long time to eventually realize that 'Spades' are blacks. I still don't know what is meant here by 'a crocodile of infants'. This lack of understanding the vocabulary really interfered with the flow of the narrative for me.|(Side note: This book was made into a movie in 1986, which was a commercial flop. I would have liked to order the DVD as well, but I wasn't sure if it would play on my DVD player. Also, according to the Wiki entry, the story was changed quite a bit for the movie. You may have heard the David Bowie song of the same title, written as the theme song for this movie. It hit #2 on the U.K. charts.)|If you're looking for action-packed adventure or a heartfelt love story that will make you weep, this isn't the place to find it. But if you're looking for top-notch writing, deep thoughts packaged in entertaining and engaging characters, and a portrait of a generation that is both timeless and inextricably bound up in its setting, you should get a copy of this book and set aside an afternoon (it's a fairly quick read) to read it. I loved this book for its energy, its youthfulness, its optimism and its realism. Reading it made me feel like a teenager again - populated as it is with young people who were England's first ever teenagers (and doing far more with their youth than I ever did with mine). The distrust of adults and the scepticism of their austere rules creates a bubble in which young people move, with a freedom adults resent. |And of course, it just goes to show that the same arguments come round again and again. The Notting Hill race riots of 1958 were one more example of scapegoating minorities, and the narrator (author) is a refreshingly liberal voice from the era in the same way young people today are more accepting of difference and change. The unnamed narrator may use pejorative terms like 'Spade' and 'Poof', but he likes black people and gay people, and he sees no reason why what makes them different to the white straight majority should stop everyone getting along.|It's also an unromantic love letter to London. |So many great passages from the book that if I started quoting I'd never stop. I understand Absolute Beginners is one of three books by MacInnes themed on London and black culture in the 50s, and I'll get around to reading the other two some day. |(Despite being a massive Bowie fan I've never seen the film, but from what I know of it I can see how hard it must have been to capture the book's implicit wonder at being alive in any film starring Patsy Kensit.)|(Oh! But the theme song from the film is great.) After I got a little bit into this book, with its outdated slang and its theme of youth rebellion and after glancing at the copyright page -- it first came out in 1959 -- I realized, \\\"Ah, this is the British response to 'On the Road.'\\\" England is a smaller country, of course, so instead of tooling across the North American continent in search of wigged out jazz musicians and so on, the characters are taking cabs between Soho and Notting Hill to listen to some skiffle in a pub. And instead of Dean Moriarty's metaphysical yearning for a lost father, the main character stops in to visit his dad at his flat in Pimlico. Fair enough; there are still the junkies and queers. But even so, I started to notice something wrong: the slang, even given the trans-Atlantic differences, seemed a bit tone-deaf, and the characters spent too much time actually TALKING about the generation gap and \\\"teenagers\\\" instead of just showing what the generation was about. Then I noticed that MacInnes was born in 1914. What? Someone who was born before the Great War is trying to write a definitive novel about what it's like to be a teenager on the eve of the 1960s? It must have seemed revolutionary at the time, but now that people have their social history sorted out a little better, this novel doesn't quite work, even though Anthony Burgess actually called it one of the 100 must-reads of the 20th century, or something like that. Second in a trilogy. I'll give the other two a pass. Hugely enjoyable and a reminder that teenagers were not a construct of the 1960s. This is London in '58 - a mass of kids with attitude and cash, throwing off the shackles of post-war austerity and indulging in drink, drugs, casual sex and jazz. Everything that the oldsters hold dear is rejected, everything is new and fresh and has to have a new cool name (\\\"Fabulous Hoplite\\\" and the \\\"Ex-Deb-of-Last-Year\\\"). Our narrator is a teenage photographer out for kicks, a proper Londoner who can barely bring himself to move out of his manor and nothing gets him more than the friction between the indiginous brainless youth (The Teds) and the coloured immigrant labour (constantly and I'm afraid probably authentically called \\\"spades\\\"). Everything is in ferment - black against white, old against young, big ideas in the smallness of their world. A bible of late fifties cool. I love this book. I read it at that special time when I was a teenager as with Catcher in the Rye when these two novels meant the world to me because I could identify with the main characters. I am certain that if I first read them as an adult I would not hold these two books so dear. Nostalgia is a great thing.|I think Absolute Beginners suffered in popularity because of the 1986 film, as I recall they left out my favourite character The Great Hopite and I didn't care for all the Jazz hand/pointy toed pirouette dancey bits that were not in the book. It was definitely a cool trendy book to read before the film and now no one talks about it much which is a shame because it is a great book. Mysteriously out of print for many years, this classic novel of teenage life in fifties and sixties London charts the late and largely unlamented cafe bar culture of the period, full of sharp suits and casual violence. Despite being slightly dated, in particular due to its outdated terminology, the book evokes the period in expert fashion. It is chiefly memorable for its depiction of early immigration into Britain from Africa and the Caribbean. Made into a by all accounts lamentable film featuring Patsy Kensit.\",\n          \"If I had to describe this book in one sentence - little stories that magically contain big and excitingly complex ideas. |Writers aren't evaluated in the context of history as stringently as artists are. There are artists alive now who can paint with the technical bravura of the likes of Tintoretto or Titian but no one, understandably, is interested in their work. I suppose this conundrum was most famously demonstrated by the Dutch forger Van Meegeren who resented the fact that the art world showed no interest in his dated derivative work and so forged Vermeer paintings as if it's technical skill alone that distinguishes genius. Recently I read some of the books by William Trevor and you could say he too, like Van Meegeren was a forger. He appropriated the distinctive style of past masters - and yet, as if the past had never happened, he receives the acclaim no painter doing the same thing would get. What I'm getting at is that if you put Akutagawa in the context of history it's remarkable how innovative and pioneering these stories are, especially considering many were written before Calvino was even born (the writer Akutagawa most reminds me of some ways) and before Katherine Mansfield was being credited for evolving the possibilities of the short story. (How I wish she had read him!) Put him in the context of history and Akutagawa is a marvel. Not that he isn't a marvel whatever way you look at him.| Stand outs are his unreliable narrators in Rashomon where eye witnesses to a mysterious death all give conflicting accounts of what happened. Dragon: The Old Potter's Tale where a ridiculed monk with a big nose as revenge posts a notice declaring the dragon of the lake will ascend to heaven on the third day of the third month. Much to his amazement a massive crowd gathers on that day. Here, as DeLillo would be years later, Akutagawa is fascinated by the pull and power of the crowd. Red Onions where a young girl living from hand to mouth in a bedsit goes out on her first date and is suitably lit up by romantic expectation but discovers the highlight of the evening are the cheap red onions she stumbles upon (Akutagawa doesn't hold romantic aspiration in high esteem!) And finally the last autobiographical story where the narrator is plagued by a concatenation of disarming synchronicities which gives you an idea why Akutagawa was to kill himself soon after. |Brilliantly fresh and compelling from start to finish.  It is probably not very rare when an extremely gifted person emerges on this planet. But it is rare when this person manages to absorb the influences of many cultures and produce a very original innovative syntheses in his short life. The whole body of work that transcends the national boundaries and would influence a way of writing for decades and even centuries. I know only three names in the 20th century Kafka, Borges and now, Akutagawa. Notably he was the first. What unites all these three, they were born either into the culture without long established national literary tradition or in the time of dramatic changes of the society and literature. I would leave Kafka aside. But both Borges and Akutagawa were immersed in many different languages and cultures since their childhood. Borges has read even Don Quixote in English. Akutagawa was reading both Japanese and Chinese traditional literature as child but also hungrily absorbed almost 200 years of the Western literature by the age of 18.|My first encounter with Akutagawa was unsuccessful. While at university, I\\u2019ve picked up his collection of short stories and found them too stylised and boring. Now many years after, my view has changed almost to the opposite extreme. I can read him many times and never get bored. In fact, I absolutely admire the versatility of his gift. His variety of styles is exceptionally wide. And he was always experimenting with his method and searching for new techniques through his short life. He never was totally satisfied it seems. He changed the decorations and styles. But there is one thing which always present in his tales. It is authenticity of human feelings. It is also amazing how many writers he anticipated, including Kafka and Borges but even Knausgaard though it might sound incredible to start with. |I\\u2019ve read much bigger volume of his stories in Russian. Not that big part of his work has been translated into English. But I think this collection contains many of his best tales with a few notable exceptions. I would just pause on a few to underscore the versatility of his gift:|\\u201cRashomon\\u201d and \\u201cIn a Bamboo grove\\u201d. Those two are the most famous as they were the base of the movie by Kurosawa. But purely from the perspective of the literature, the second one stands out. Apparently it is the first time ever when a bunch of unreliable narrators are describing the same story from the different perspective, contradicting each other. And the single \\u201ctruth\\u201d is never revealed. Robert Browning apparently did something similar in |The Ring and the Book| but Akutagawa raised it to the totally different level with the open ending. Now we are so much get used to this tool. But even from the perspective of our century, this is the one of the most elegant and economically told stories of this type.|\\u201cHell Screen\\u201d - this is not a medieval tale. This is a philosophic investigation about the dominance of the high art over reality. Apparently Akutagawa visited an anatomy morgue to write this story.|\\u201cThe story of head fell off\\u201d - it is included here in a comical section, but there is nothing comical about this story. And the image of a deep blue sky getting closer and closer would stay with me for a long time.|\\u201cGreen onions\\u201d - this story I would not be surprised to find between early Chekhov tales.

It is included into |Rashomon and Other Stories|. It is a tale about the feeling of a \\u201clittle\\u201d person modelled on Gogol\\u2019s Overcoat. As far as I remember, Gogol\\u2019s character dies from the shock of loosing the overcoat. But Akutagawa has twisted the tale asking very different question: what if he would get what he dreams about? And there is no Akaki Akakievich. He has been replaced by a samurai.|\\u201cHandkerchief\\u201d - It is available in English as well. It is included into |Mandarins: Stories by Ry\\u016bnosuke Akutagawa|. The collection of the recently translated stories by Archipelago press. What a clever short story this is! On the surface it is about East-West and its mutual accommodation. But this is not a simple story. It is one of those tales like a matreshka doll. You\\u2019ve opened one not expecting to find another, but it is in there. And then - one more. And the smallest one does not look anything like the initial one and leaves you puzzled what was the story about really.|Now the section called \\u201cAkutagawa own story\\u201d. While reading the introduction in my Russian collection, I\\u2019ve learned a lot about the state of the Japanese literature at the time. Due to the Meji reformation and opening to the West, they tried to build up their modern literature by absorbing around 200 years of the Western Canon. Obviously they were loosing themselves in the process. Apparently they did not have a concept of a novel per se. So in 1885 Tsubouchi Sh\\u014dy\\u014d (1859-1935) a literary critic, translator of Western literature, and novelist formulated the principle for the Japanese fiction in his work\\u00a0Sh\\u014dsetsu Shinzui\\u00a0(The Essence of the Novel). He came to the conclusion that the descriptive realism should be the way to go. This has apparently helped to focus the minds of the Japanese writers. |Many of them has taken the idea even a step further following the theory that only object a person could know truthfully is her/himself. As a result they developed something called |\\\"I-novel\\\" (\\u79c1\\u5c0f\\u8aac, Shish\\u014dsetsu, Watakushi Sh\\u014dsetsu)| where a writer would describe both his mental and physical life in its daily details with the varied level of psychological depth. So the fashionable 21th century auto-fiction was in fact born in Japan about a century earlier. I was amazed to find that out. But why i am talking about it? Akutagawa initially considered it more or less as lazy and limiting exercise. But then, at some stage, in his last decade he has started to experiment with the method. At the same time he kept experimenting with the style, used huge range of framing devices from the letters to the dialogues and the sketchs of unwritten novels (the device later successfully used by Borges who loved Akutagawa's work). He also kept his psychological complexity in these stories. And his very last tales before his suicide are read more like impressionistic pieces full of terrible beauty rather than the confessional tales. |One serious omission form this part of this collection is \\u201cDialogue in darkness\\u201d, the story that is written as a conversation between Akutagawa and the angel or maybe he is the fallen angel who has become a devil. I\\u2019ve searched whether the story exists in English. But did not find anything conclusive. The story was published posthumously. And I wanted to finish with the quote from there:|D. You will very likely die soon.|Akutagawa: But that thing which has created me at the first place will create the second me.|And the \\u201csecond him\\u201d is the powerful and omnipresent influence in the world literature since. \\u201cIn fulfillment of his longstanding dream, he became the author of several books. But what he got in return was a desolate loneliness.\\u201d| |This collection offers a piercing insight into the stunning yet troubled mind of Ry\\u016bnosuke Akutagawa. A writer brought to the world by a madwoman, he was a well-known insomniac, a drug addict, a guilt-plagued sinner, yet he produced such beautiful works while hounded by the looming shadows of his inevitable insanity. |This masterwork can be adequately divided into three parts: the first part (A World in Decay & Under the Sword) are vivid myth-like stories set during the Heian, Kamakura, and other pre-war eras of Japan. From the titular story of an encounter under the Rash\\u014dmon (a gate built as a monument in the southern entrance of Kyoto) to the story of a painter who perfectly depicted the fury of hell into a screen, the first few stories present such beautiful and breath-taking pictures of early Japan in all its splendor with its unique culture and oriental beliefs in full display. |The second part (Modern Tragicomedy) are surrealistic stories set during Akutagawa\\u2019s lifetime towards the dusk of the Meija era and the early smoldering of the Taisho. These haunting yet humorous stories reflect the slowly decaying psyche of Akutagawa as his fears and nerves start to take hold of his pen. |And the last part (Akutagawa\\u2019s Own Story) are his final manuscripts towards the end of his life when all he could muster to craft were words formed by his horrors and his painful loneliness. In one of its few bright spots he writes, |\\u201cIn my savage joy, I felt as if I had no parents, no wife, no children, just the life that flowed forth from my pen.\\u201d| But these last few remnants of thought from this gifted storyteller evoke mostly the sorrowful darkness of a mind in despair whose only solace was literature. The different eras of Japan were his canvas, his brushstrokes his blood, wrung out unbearably, drop by drop, till he had none more to bleed.|\\u201cI don\\u2019t have the strength to keep writing this. To go on living with this feeling is painful beyond description. Isn\\u2019t there someone kind enough to strangle me in my sleep?\\u201d| |What initially was a beautiful and elegant collection morphed into an outpouring of literary agony towards the end. In this regard it is like a Chimera, a two-fold beast, formed by the fictional beauty of Akutagawa\\u2019s tales and the painful terrors of his grotesque reality. One night, I woke in the dark hours no longer able to sleep. After a while I accepted my semi-wakeful state and found my way to the sofa. There I settled under a blanket and flicked ideally through the TV channels, eventually I happened upon a film |Ghost Dog|, not apparently to be confused with |Moondog| | although to my mind ghost dogs and moondogs must be much of a muchness, no? |, anyway the film seemed to be pleasing pretentious and about right for being neither asleep nor awake but watching moving pictures on a screen. Two of the stories in this collection were made in to a film, but the powers of the night which decide our sleeping have so far not decreed that I must see that film in the early hours of a star lit morning so I haven't.|As it happened the film made mention of the story collection | Rashomon| which seemed to be of some importance to the title character and his philosophical stance and so when it came to pass that I was gripped, not by midnight wakefulness but by mid-afternoon book madness, I ordered it from the library and in time it came to me from Gravesend, so if you are in Gravesend it will be a couple of days before it is back with you - patience!|Akutagawa chronologically is approximately a contemporary of Katherine Mansfield, he also died young and was much concerned in his fiction with death and psychology, but unlike her at least based on the stories I've read, he has a broader range of story settings and is somewhat less interested in gender and romantic relationships. In this volume the stories range from the title story set in medieval Japan to the recent past to his own days in inter-war Japan. Both Mansfield and Akutagawa were fellow travellers in their modernism, attempting to capture the fleeting contact of human awareness of the moment and the fractured, unreliable perception of an individual.|Really these are stories one could read repeatedly and I recommend them warmly, despite the grimness of the autobiographical ones which twist around fears of madness and thoughts of suicide | which ultimately led to the end of the author's own life|.|Yes, Modernism, madness and death - everybody's favourites, I am plainly really going out of my way to encourage you to try these. So what can I say that is a bit more tempting? Dare I mention the wide range of styles, the sometimes uneasy mixture of the Japanese and the European? Akutagawa was a big fan of Dostoevsky and the fin de Siecle writers, indeed one story here may be a Japanesed version of Grushenka's Story of an Onion from |The Brothers Karamazov|, then again it could be, I suppose, a Buddhist folktale. There's also a lot of humour, in different registers, in one story a man in Manchuria suddenly finds he has horse's legs and we find that eventually nature is stronger than nurture, in another a waitress struggling to get by on romantic dreams and a low wage, might be about to be seduced by a man when she spots spring onions on sale at a bargain price. |So great variety and a glimpse into the troubled soul of another person, quite a lot in just over two hundred pages of extremely short short-stories. And there's more... an introduction by Haruki Murikami assesses Akutagawa in the context of a Japanese writer attempting to find his own voice while drawing upon both Japanese and European literary heritages; 'I love Dostoevsky and Strindberg and Flaubert and I am a discipline of Natsume Soseki'. Murikami holds that Akutagawa's literary dead end in trying to marry the traditions in himself led to his physically premature dead-end, in which case the introduction is a kind of meta-fiction and we can read all eighteen stories in the collection as nestled within it the multiple attempts of a prisoner to escape their unique cell. He tries historical settings, Chinese settings, contemporary settings, he draws on his life experience, his personal history as a adopted child is reflected in his divided literary heritage, so we are treated to a fireworks display of creativity, it has to stop of course, as all fireworks' displays must, but it is spectacular while it lasts.|The perfect example of Murikami's point is the story | On a Bamboo Grove| which places the reader in the position of an examining magistrate of early medieval Japan - we read a collection of testimonies relating to the discovery of a dead body in said bamboo grove. Are any of them true? Even taking the testimonies together and mentally reconstructing events is that the truth of what happens? Is there an objective truth beyond that a man who was once alive is now dead? For practical reasons in daily life in order to have a functioning legal system we pretend that this is so, but as a writer appealing to readers Akutagawa makes a different point, the same one maybe as he makes throughout all these stories even or particularly in the fictionalised ones based on his own life. For a person drunk on the film society culture prevalent in Kerala during the Seventies and Eighties, \\\"Rashomon\\\" is a magic word.|Akira Kurasowa\\u2019s film enjoys cult status among movie buffs. It is rivetting in its presentation of \\u201ctruth\\u201d in many layers, presented as a conversation among three people: a woodcutter, a priest and a commoner who take shelter under the ramshackle Rashomon city gates to escape a downpour. The story is the death (murder?) of a man, the rape (?) of a woman and the capture of a bandit responsible (?) for both: as the story unfolds, the differences in the widely varying testimonies of the people involved force us to have a rethink on what \\u201ctruth\\u201d means.|I had heard about this movie a lot before actually seeing it; and it lived up to its hype and more when I finally got around to seeing it. But this review is not about the movie. It is about the magical short story which was its inspiration \\u2013 and other stories like it, penned by one of the great figures of Japanese literatures, the turn-of-the-century novelist Ryunosuke Akutagawa.|When I first saw the movie, I was so taken up by the sheer visual beauty of Kurasowa\\u2019s storytelling that I did not ruminate much on what this movie was based on, even though I saw the \\u201cbased on\\u2026\\u201d title in the beginning. It was only after joining Goodreads that I came to know about this book, and was immediately hungry for it. Having read it, it has left me hungry for more by the same author, and Japanese literature in general. It is so shattering in its impact on the intellect, even in translation; I cannot imagine how powerful it must be in the original Japanaese \\u2013 for, as Haruki Murakami says in the introduction, the translation can never capture the power of the original.|Akutagawa is a tragic figure. His mother went mad shortly after his birth, and he was raised by his childless maternal uncle and aunt. Even though they were a highly cultured family and young Ryunosuke was lucky to have a childhood exposed to a lot of intellectual pleasures, he was constantly plagued by ill-health and bullying in school. His ill-health continued into youth: he suffered from chronic insomnia and fears of madness. The misfortunes of family and country also distressed his oversensitive soul to an inordinate extent. Until finally, on 24 July 1927, Ryunosuke Akutagawa committed suicide by an overdose of Veronal.|The author\\u2019s gifted and tortured soul is visible throughout this amazing collection of stories. It is divided into four sections: (1) A World in Decay, (2) Under the Sword, (3) Modern Tragicomedy and (4) Akutagawa\\u2019s Own Story. These sections correspond to four periods of Japanese history as well as four creative styles which took birth from Akutagawa\\u2019s fertile imagination.|In the first section, stories (most of them retelling of old legends) set in the Heian Period (A.C.E. 794 \\u2013 1185) are included. This was Japan\\u2019s classical era; a time of peace, prosperity and opulence when art and culture flourished. But as is common with most ancient kingdoms, it declined and power slipped from the hands of the aristocrats into the hands of the warlords. It is this twilight period that Akutagawa uses as a backdrop for his stories of degeneration and decay. The title story of the collection, Rashomon, encapsulates the entire misery of the country in the symbol of the gate of the capital city of Kyoto. The city having been struck by one calamity after another, the author says:|With the whole city in such turmoil, no one bothered to maintain the Rashomon. Foxes and badgers came to live in the dilapidated structure, and they were soon joined by thieves. Finally, it became the custom to abandon unclaimed corpses in the upper storey of the gate, which made the neighbourhood an eerie place that everyone avoided after the sun went down.|The stage is thus perfectly set for a set of disturbing stories. |Rashomon| narrates the story of a jobless servant who is sheltering from the rain inside the gate and an old woman, who steals hair from the corpses lying there to sell to wig-makers, justifying it by pointing out that the dead people were also thieves and cheaters. Ultimately, she inspires the servant to become a thief himself who starts off on his new career by stealing her clothes!|In a Bamboo Grove|, one of the most extraordinary stories ever written (this was the inspiration for Kurasowa\\u2019s film, even though he used the Rashomon gate as a symbol of the decay he was portraying) narrates story of a dead warrior, a thief and a raped woman from the viewpoint of each of the protagonists. Each of the stories is different and equally believable from the evidence available at the scene of the crime and the statements of the witnesses. Who we believe will depend a lot on who we are.|But the story which impressed me most in the whole volume is |Hell Screen|. This gem of a novelette gives us a taste of horror, Japanese style \\u2013 I could understand how movies like |Dark Water|, |The Ring| and |The Grudge| came into being. The tale of the deformed artist Yoshihide (nicknamed \\u201cMonkeyhide\\u201d because of his deformity), the tapestry of hell he paints for the Lord Horikawa, the artist\\u2019s daughter who is a serving girl at the Lord\\u2019s mansion and the pet monkey has all the elements of a medieval ghost story and a gothic romance. However, it is Akutagawa\\u2019s narrative style (whereby he leaves a lot unsaid) and his choice of the narrative voice (that of an unnamed member of the Lord\\u2019s retinue) that are masterful. The story is a one way ride into darkness.|In the second section, we move forward to the Tokugawa Shogunate (A.C.E. 1600 \\u2013 1868). This was the last feudal military government of Japan. During this period, the shogun elders of the Tokugawa clan ruled from Edo Castle. As Jay Rubin, the translator, says, the Tokugawa centralised feudalism \\u201cimposed the principle of joint responsibility on all parts of society, punishing whole families, entire villages, or professional guilds for the infractions of individual members. This fostered a culture based on mutual spying, which promoted a mentality of constant vigilance and self-censorship.\\u201d|In the story |Loyalty|, the disastrous effects of the madness of a samurai on an entire dynasty is described: in this merciless world, it does not mean just the destruction of a person, but of a whole bloodline. The other two stories included describe the clash between Christianity and Japan\\u2019s traditional religions. These distressing tales are rendered with much empathy and wit.|In the third section we find a sarcastic Akutagawa, full of black humour. |The Story of the Head that Fell Off| and |Horse Legs| use the trappings of fantasy to create a sort of darkly comic tale. In |Green Onions|, we can see an author smiling at himself and his fellow-scribes, in a pastiche of a romantic tale.|There is a whole tradition of autobiographical writing in Japan, called \\u201cI-Novels\\u201d, where the author\\u2019s life itself is fictionalised. Even though Akutagawa initially stayed away from this genre, he finally succumbed to peer and critic pressure and started writing such stories. It is here that one can see a fine mind finally unravelling. There are hints of this in the first three stories, especially in |The Writer\\u2019s Craft| where an author is forced write an elegy for somebody whom he barely knows; just on the strength of his writing talent. This sense of unease is increased in |Death Register| where he tabulates the demise of friends and relatives: and in |The Diary of a Stupid Man| and |Spinning Gears| (where Akutagawa keeps on hallucinating spinning gears on one side of his vision), we sense that we are standing on the edge of a minefield. (|Spinning Gears| was published posthumously.)|This is a well-chosen set of stories, with a fantastic introduction by Haruki Murakami. There are explanations about the historical periods, and background information on each story. The timeline of Akutagawa\\u2019s life is also provided. The book satisfies one, not only literally, but also as a window to Japanese literature.|Highly recommended.|Review also posted on my | |BLOG| |. Good, but...| Yes. I did it. I've committed one of the ultimate literary sacrileges of all time. I read Akutagawa Ryunosuke in translation when I could have read it in original Japanese. I am guilty as charged. I just couldn't resist a book with such a cool cover and Murakami's introduction |plus| his trusted Jay Rubin doing the translation. |Having said that, I did read it along with the actual Japanese text in front of me to see how well Jay Rubin has grappled with difficult early 19th-century Japanese and rendered it into English. And the result was somewhat disappointing. I think he does a good job translating Murakami's works, but here with Akutagawa, he pretty much butchers most of his early stories that take place in medieval Japan (which stories, by the way, are usually extolled as his masterpieces). The original Japanese is, of course, in medieval Japanese, and it is quite different from modern Japanese (but not as different as modern English to Chaucer's middle English). But Mr. Rubin sometimes translates conversations into highly colloquial English, and that just doesn't work with Akutagawa's early stories.|The Japanese language - still today and even more so back in the day - is a very |polite| language, which logically makes it a very |vague| language as well, where curse words don't really exist and you say things in a very roundabout way. And to render this into modern colloquial English is like equivalent to rendering Shakespeare into today's slang with an abundance of \\\"F\\\" and \\\"N\\\" and other such words. Now from a reader's point of view, Mr. Rubin's translation is very readable. Very. It could have, however, been a lot more conservative on the use of colloquialism and slang without compromising its readability. |For example, in one of the scenes, a lord tells his trusted servant to kill someone, and the original reads more or less, \\\"Kill that man, that Rin'emon,\\\" which Mr. Rubin translates as \\\"Kill that bastard!\\\" Alright. This does show the degree to which this guy is mad (in fact crazy), but I'm sorry, that just doesn't work. The word \\\"bastard\\\" is just way too much of a bad word for someone like a lord himself could utter (and I don't think there was an equivalent in medieval Japanese). I do recognize the difficulty since the Japanese here is very very subtle. The meaning is close to \\\"bastard,\\\" but a LOT less blatant than what the English word conveys. In many many instances Mr. Rubin resorts to colloquial English that sounds too jarring to a Japanese ear when compared to the subtle nuances and beauty of the original Japanese. But that's just me, who is fortunate enough to be able to read both Japanese and English with more or less equal fluency. So as far as the translation is concerned, hats off to Mr. Rubin for making Akutagawa's stories easily available for the English-speaking public, but as an artistic work, it could have done much better by avoiding too much colloquialism and using more formal (and even a bit archaic) English to better convey the original voice of the text.|W/r/t the stories, they are really good. I'd even say he's Japan's Chekhov. In fact, you could see an exotic blend of Kafka, Gogol, Chekhov, and even Dostoevsky at work behind these stories. My personal favorites are his famous \\\"Hell Screen\\\" (intense and just awesome), \\\"In the Bamboo Grove\\\" (Kurosawa's Rashomon is based on this), and \\\"Horse legs\\\" (which is very Kafkaesque and just funny). \\\"Loyalty\\\" is also excellent in terms of it psychological insights. Though I wasn't a big fan of his later, autobiographical stories, they were strangely engaging. It's just too bad that one of his most famous stories, \\\"Kappa,\\\" is not included in this collection. Overall, it's a good short anthology of Akutagawa's stories. I was Compelled to read this after loving Akira Kurosawa's classic film. Most of the stories are superb, with Akutagawa's prose full of such fluidity. He really catches you out with some beautiful quirks of description, sharp bouts of humour, and many revelations in a short space of time that it's no wonder he is considered one of Japan's greatest short-story writers.

About a third of these stories are easily knock-out 5-star fantastic. The other two-thirds I'd rate mostly 4 stars with a few 3 stars. All worth reading and in general I think this is probably a good intro to Akutagawa's work in that it contains a nice cross-section of his work from the earliest historical stories to his later primarily autobiographical stories.|I personally preferred the earlier stories which ranged from tales of Samurai warriors and Shoguns and stories of religious persecution when Christianity was making inroads in Japan to satyrical stories about unfortunates with big noses.* While the settings are completely foreign to me, the characters are people I know all too well. My favorite story being \\\"Hell Screen\\\" in which an egotistical painter is commissioned to paint a screen depicting the horrors of hell. In order to sketch the scenes, he puts his assistants through a myriad of tortures and all I'll add in an effort to not give too much away is that karma is a bitch! These early stories have an almost Victorian gothic creepiness to them but it's a bit more subtle and far more insidious in that it seems infinitely more real. And Akutagawa has a nice dollop of humor running throughout these early stories as well.|The later autobiographical stories in which he writes of his mother who went mad, of his infidelities and his fear of going mad himself and his increasing depression that led to his eventual suicide are painful to read in how human and easy to relate to they are. But having read Dazai's similarly themed autobiographical stories not too long ago, Akutagawa didn't have quite the gut punch that Dazai had for me. Akutagawa's story \\\"The Spinning Gears\\\" was the best of the autobiographical bunch for me. Throughout, he continues to have visions of gears that nearly block out his vision. Those of us who have the luxury to think about life beyond just worrying about food and shelter can probably all relate to this nightmare of the cogs of life just taking over. The horror element of his earlier stories definitely comes into play here.|There's a slightly strange intro to this collection by Haruki Murakami which is far more critical of Akutagawa's work than I might have expected though it did seem like a relatively fair critique. I'm glad I read it after reading the stories though.|-----------------------|*When I studied Chinese, my teachers were all native Chinese, mostly on exchange and when we learned the word for \\\"nose\\\" we also learned that Americans are frequently called \\\"big nose\\\" so I had a good chuckle seeing that the Japanese are equally amused by big noses. I always think I don't enjoy short story collections. There're sometimes one or two short stories that I find interesting but others often merge into the formless forgettable mass (unless it's Alice Munro and then there are none). Then I encounter a collection like this and start doubting my preconceived ideas about my relationship with the form. |This was a fascinating collection. Starting with Akutagawa's take on the old stories and ending with closely autobiographical confessions of the paranoid depressed macabre mind. |Akutagawa is very well-versed in the western literature, he's particularly attracted to the psychological novels of the 19th century. I can see Poe's eerie influence in \\\"Hell screen\\\" story (one of my favorite retellings of the old tales), I also see Gogol in \\\"Horse legs\\\". And then there's the heartbreaking cycle of autobiographical stories of unravelling mind. He is lonely, perturbed, obsessed with death, self-doubting and struggling with inferiority complex regarding his skills, continually calling himself an idiot. This is an anxious, ill mind you're uncomfortable to spend time in, not gonna lie. (the last two stories are published posthumously after he killed himself, the second story was left unfinished, his brain just gave up on concentration needed to finish a story)|All in all, a very interesting collection I recommend to everybody: first stories to lovers of myths and fables; and the last stories to lovers of psychological. What I love about Rashomon is that it signifies pretentious snobbery so perfectly. Like, if you want to impress someone at a cocktail party, \\\"I didn't understand truth until I saw Rashomon,\\\" you might say. Did I say impress? I meant impress upon them that you would be super boring to go on a date with. You can win any argument by nominating Rashomon because no real people have actually seen it.|Anyway, I haven't seen it.|I read the book though! Here it is! No, not the one called Rashomon. That's actually about something totally different. Rashomon the movie was mostly based on a different story by this same guy, called \\\"In a Bamboo Grove.\\\" I know this from |reading the introduction.| Would you like to go on a date with me and I'll tell you about a pretentious movie I haven't even seen.|What book do you think is the Rashomon of books?

There's a monkey.|Akutagawa is one of Japan's most famous writers. He wrote mostly short stories like these here. He committed suicide in 1927 when he was 35, overdosing on sleeping meds across the room from his wife and kids. All of the stories I read in this collection were perfect. Look, it's not that HELL SCREEN is the best name for anything ever and any story not called HELL SCREEN is stupid, but...it's not not that, either.  Akutagawa known as the |\\u201cFather of Japanese short stories\\u201d| stays true to his designation with this collection of metaphysically refined stories. The rendered stories: - The Grove, Yam Gruel, Rashomon, Martyr to name a few; highlights Akutagawa\\u2019s preference for macabre themes of immortality, depression, virtue, chaos and death. These stories encompass a constant battle of skepticism prevailing over virtue of morality v/s existence of evil.| | In Rashomon, the act of the ghoulish old woman picking out long hairs from the skulls of the corpses to make wigs and sell them to buy scraps of food delineate a desperate act to fulfill the demonic perils of life. Similarly, 'Martyr' highlights the thriving soul of hypocrisy in religion and the susceptibility to strong gossip.| | Akutagawa\\u2019s affinity for such themes brings out his real tumultuous relation with mental anxiety and clinical neurotic dwelling of his personal life. (He committed suicide at the age of 35 due to an overdose of Vernol). Furthermore, his description of kimonos/garbs adorning his protagonists illustrates a high usage of the color blue which in Japanese culture is the color of naivety,immaturity and youth.|  First read in 2007|In his characteristically measured, conversational introduction to this book, Murakami Haruki tells us that Akutagawa is his third favourite author in the modern (post 1868) Japanese canon (after Soseki and Tanizaki). Rather than giddily enthusing about the author, Murakami carefully contextualises him in Japanese literature and culture. Akutagawa lived during a brief period of prosperity and political liberalism between WWI and the Depression in 1929, and combined appreciative immersion in Japanese cultural life with passion for Western literature. He called Soseki 'The Master', and worked as an editor as well as writing; the autobiographical stories in this collection demonstrate the literariness of his short life.|As well as drawing on his own daily experience and mental anguish for source material (a form related to the 'I-novel' style of some of his contemporaries in Japanese literature), Akutagawa wrote stories set in the Edo period when Japan was governed by military overlords. Many of these have interesting historical content. He also wrote stories of his own time, with an amusing self-awareness. The writer is always a presence, even if only in the pleasurable excess of musical names.|His style is clear, lyrical and pierced here and there by vivid images, like the purple sparks made by the tram on the overhead wires that the narrator wants to hold in his hands. Murakami says 'the flow of his language... moves along like a living thing', and this translation by Jay Rubin certainly preserves this natural, dynamic, unforced quality. |One technique that I particularly liked and that is original or at least unusual is the one he employs in 'Hell Screen' as well as other pieces, that of using a disapproving narrator to tell the hero's story. This device not only actively engages the reader's sympathy with the protagonists, but also creates a deep and nuanced impression of social exclusion and isolation. \\u201cThe cable was still sending sharp sparks into the air. He could think of nothing in life that he especially desired, but those purple sparks\\u2014those wildly-blooming flowers of fire\\u2014he would trade his life for the chance to hold them in his hands.\\u201d|I came upon a review comparing Akutagawa\\u2019s writing to \\u201cshoots of flame visible through the snow\\u201d (quoting a Mishima story), which is very apt. Akutagawa\\u2019s writing burns with a lurid glow\\u2014well suited to his macabre sense of humor. Less so in the later stories in this collection, with his fear of madness, and his thoughts of suicide (which he would eventually commit), and his misgivings about living a life of literature. DNF @ 39%|These stories are not bad but I just can't muster any real enthusiasm for them.|It is not helped by the stories being unconneced and by themselves not being great examples of the short story format.|Of course, they were not written as short stories in the Western literary sense. It's just that the way they are written is boring me stiff.|Maybe I'll pick this up again at a later date, but right now, this is not working for me. Akutagawa is one of my favorite writers. He took his own life with barbiturates at age 35 and left behind some 300 stories, sketches, articles and literary experiments. In English he has appeared in over a dozen collections of the same 20-30 most famous stories retranslated a dozen times. This latest collection, translated by the consummate Jay Rubin, has a lovingly detailed introduction by the inimitable Haruki Murakami. It is a mere sampling of 18 stories from his impossibly good body of work. Unlike Toson, Soseki and Tanizaki, Akutagawa did not embark on massive literary projects. Instead, he honed his craft with precision and an appreciation for classic storytelling. I have read some of his stories ten times, and they always elicit a strong response from me. |In a lot of ways, he resembles Gogol, and even composed an homage with his story \\\"The Nose.\\\" Though different in content, the tone is reminiscent of the Russian master. This is one of the masterpieces contained in this treasury. The others include: \\\"Rashomon, In a Bamboo Grove, Hell Screen, Spinning Gears, Death Register, and the Life of a Stupid Man.\\\" Even the ones that are not masterworks per se, are extremely entertaining. \\\"Green Onions, The Story of the Head that Fell Off, Horse Legs, and Loyalty\\\" fall into this category. If you are new to this author, you may not enjoy all of his tales, but I believe you will appreciate many aspects of his singular talent.|He writes a few different types of stories: 1). retellings of classic tales from Chinese and other sources. These read a little like fables. 2.) Autobiographical tales: these are often depressing, taking details of his haunted life and casting them bleakly against the backdrop of his times. 3). Religious tales like \\\"Christ of Nanking\\\" (not included in the collection) and others. Historical tales, taking place well before the author's time but possessing uncanny verisimilitude.|In his stories you will find traces of his influences: Anatole France, Strindberg, Merimee, Goethe, Nagoya Shiga, Soseki, Toson, Tanizaki, Basho, Doppo, Ogai, Pu Songling and dozens of other European and Chinese authors. He has rewritten stories from Pu Songling's collections as well as retold many from the seminal Japanese proto-mythologies.|Akutagawa draws from Buddhism, Shintoism, Christianity and Myth. I think he is one of the most interesting writers I have ever encountered because he processes other literary worlds into new forms. Even when he waxes esoteric, he is charming and insightful. He explores human nature with deep characters and memorable comedy and tragedy.|This brilliant edition includes thorough notes by Rubin explaining the finer points of the stories. There is enough material in this singular Penguin edition to write a dissertation on Akutagawa. Jay Rubin has put in an astounding effort toward accuracy and illumination. I only wish he would continue with further volumes of stories.|If you appreciate the stories of Chekhov, Gogol, Maupassant, and Dostoyevsky, you will find a lot to love about this author. Typically, you can expect tortured artists, explorations of morality and death, futility and hope, love and loss. Very classic themes. \\\"Green Onions\\\" and \\\"O-gin\\\" were odd but welcome selections for this book. Overall, it is the most well-rounded collection of the author's writings in English.|I have so far discovered 107 Akutagawa tales in English. I've read every anthology of Japanese literature, every collection of his tales and tracked down out of print Japanese-American periodicals through JSTOR. I want to thank Ryan C. K. Choi and N. A. Feathers for publishing new translations of his work on their websites. This incredible author has not gotten a full treatment in English and I implore translators to get to work on making his complete works available. So far we have only about 900 pages of stories, when obscure, ancient masters like Pu Songling have been translated more comprehensively. Along with this collection you will want to read two more collections: Mandarins, translated by Charles de Wolf, and The Beautiful and Grotesque, which includes \\\"Kappa,\\\" his novella.|Though Akutagawa's accomplishment is profoundly important (far more so, I would argue, than Murakami claims in his indicting introduction), one wonders what heights Akutagawa might have reached had he endured the agonies of his intellectual rigors for decades longer. Was he capable of writing novels? Were the demons he wrote about in \\\"Spinning Gears\\\" exaggerated or as sincerely recorded as in Strindberg's Inferno? These questions will never be answered. But part of his appeal is how digestible and varied his work is.|This is undoubtedly one of the greatest short story collections by any Japanese or non-Western author. Throughout my life I've been experiencing the strangest tendency when reading a really great literary work: after finishing a particularly brilliant passage/story/poem, I just have to put the book down for while, to stop reading it altogether as if I was afraid that this was the peak and nothing better will follow. Sometimes this takes days of sweet pondering upon the writer's craft. I like savouring these moments, they occur rarely, bringing me much pleasure and gently nudging me into thinking about beauty. Many Akutagawa's short stories gave me this feeling, especially those that were about medieval Japan and the samurai (especially |In a Bamboo Grove|, |Hell Screen| or |Loyalty|). I find it extremely hard to comment on such brilliantly crafted small literary worlds. It's always difficult to describe perfection, you just have to experience it and then you know: this is |it|. I feel the compliments are also in order for Jay Rubin, the translator, who rendered these stories so beautifully into English.|On the other hand, this book seemed utterly depressing to me. Akutagawa is preoccupied with death and suicide in quite an unhealthy manner, which is surely due to his mental illness. Naturally, this issue is a fact of life, not a bad thing in itself, but the way this volume is compiled and filled with incredibly elaborate commentary on the autobiographical element of his writing, one sort of feels like sinking into that utter darkness with the author (the most dismal posthumously published stories are ordered in the end of this compilation). Thus, Akutagawa would be one of those artists that I put into a special category of mine - the writers that I consider truly gifted (if not even genius), but for various reasons I can't relate to them personally. |His own works were unlikely to appeal to people who were not like him and had not lived a life like this| ...as Akutagawa wrote himself. He tells us later that he is the one that believes in the existence of darkness only, not in the light. It leaves me just wondering how much of this is the result his depression or unhappy personal circumstances and how much the influence of fin-de-si\\u00e8cle literature he was devouring, an influence on his life that is duly acknowledged. |So, there he is - a master of words, a strange man... I guess this is the black and the white of this reading experience. A damn intense reading experience. Pre-review:| to tell the truth, the reason why I finally got my lazy butt up to seriously read contemporary Japanese literature (aside from the usual reads of Haruki Murakami, Yukio Mishima, Rampo Edogawa and all the other Japanese crime and mystery good stuff etc) is this: the |Bungo Stray Dogs manga seriess| LOL| | |Early this mornin', when you knocked upon my door|Early this mornin', ooh, when you knocked upon my door|And I said, \\\"Hello, Satan, I believe it's time to go\\\"|Me and the devil, was walkin' side by side|Me and the devil, ooh, was walkin' side by side|-Me and the Devil Blues-|Robert Johnson| | |(1) So far I am still in the Introduction part, but an introduction written by Haruki Murakami is definitely worth reading, for example, the part he commented as a novelist that Akutagawa's use of language is 'sharp and beautiful', the way he analysed another artist's works, his personal history and faimly history and the historical background! And it doesn't surprise me that he compares Akutagawa with Fitzgerald! (the short essay Murakami had written about Fitzgerald is beautiful as well). |(2) The Nose is an interesting case study of human emotions of shame, pity, self-image and malice.|(3) the fact that Rashomon is among Akutagawa's first short stories is quite impressive, and in Chinese we still use the term 'Rashomon effect' a lot. LOL|(4) When I was re-reading |The Spider Spread| and |Hell Screen|, I feel a sense of despair: Heaven is too far away but Hell and its darkness is hot on everyone's heels.|(5) But somehow I think the movie adaptation of 'Rashomon' (actually the movie is the mixture of the short stories |'Rashomon'| and |'In a Bamboo Grove'|) is a bit more impressive than its novel counterpart.|More to come. \\\"Rashomon\\\" tells the story of a \\\"lowly servant\\\" sheltering from the rain on the steps of a rashomon (outer castle gate). He has recently been laid off and sits pondering his future. He hears a sound and ventures inside the rashomon to see what it was. Inside are heaps of dead bodies from the recent plague and a strange old woman wandering about, going through the corpses' clothes. The servant attacks the old woman, strips her of her clothing, throws her onto the heap, and runs off. |\\\"In a Bamboo Grove\\\" features a married couple and a robber. The story is told from the perspective of all witnesses and it emerges that the husband was murdered but who did it and why is the mystery. |These are the two most famous Akutagawa stories and are an excellent start to the collection. However, afterwards they become quite mediocre and even a bit tedious. The forced gothic of \\\"Hell Screen\\\" plods along until a near hysterical ending that undermines the seriousness of the story, that of obssession and the artistic mind. \\\"The Nose\\\" is a very odd story about a priest with a very big nose, has it shortened, and it grows back again. It's one of those \\\"be grateful for what you have, accept who you are\\\" type tales and not nearly as brilliant as Gogol's \\\"The Nose\\\" (Gogol being one of Akutagawa's influences and, frankly, a better short story writer). |As the title suggests there are 18 stories here but those are the only ones I can remember. The last couple in the section called \\\"Akutagawa's Own Story\\\" are interesting, with \\\"Life of a Stupid Man\\\" playing with form and presenting an interesting take on autobiography through small snippets of a life glimpsed in passing. \\\"Spinning Gears\\\" is the final story he wrote before his suicide (pills) and is about the slowly disintegrating mind of Akutagawa. The desperation and mounting paranoia give the reader an insight into Akutagawa's fragile and fractured mindset. The strange imagery is also fascinating. The spinning gears he sees around his eyes confuse and scare him while at every turn he sees signs of death - a decaying animal corpse, dying people in hospitals, and above all his morbid fear of going insane like his mother. |I won't say I didn't enjoy the book as there were some stories here that were excellent, and whether it's Jay Rubin's translation or not, the writing was always of a high standard. And students of literature will find reading \\\"Rashomon\\\" and \\\"In a Bamboo Grove\\\" very rewarding as will film students who are interested in the work of Kurasawa who based his film \\\"Rashomon\\\" on those stories. But compared to other short story writers and other Japanese writers, Akutagawa isn't nearly on their level.  Delving into Japanese classics had always been a goal of mine since I started reading more frequently. Akutagawa Ryunosuke was the first Japanese author I've read of with his work Life of a Stupid Man, an incredible piece of literature in my opinion. So here I am delving into his more of his works.|Instead of talking about this book in general, I will make a weekly discussion to dissect each short stories in depth on my Instagram @agathachristiebells. I will try not to be spoilery but if you have read it or maybe wanted to know more, there are amazing reviews and analysis online that talked about the stories in more details.|CW: suicide|Akutagwa Ryunosuke was known as Japanese Father of Short Stories. His sharp literary style and usage of language were never stagnant: \\\"it moves along like a living thing\\\". He published Rashomon in 1916 at the age of 23-years-old and was praised by the legendary writer Natsume Soseki. Akutagawa brilliantly crafted a story from classical works into a contemporary modernist literature that transcend generation. Unfortunately, he commited suicide at the age of 35, in which he wrote actively for only twelve years in his career. |1.Rashomon (1915)|Rash\\u014dmon in Kyoto was the grander of the two city gates built during\\u00a0the Heian period (794\\u20131185). In this story, calamity had struck the city of Kyoto caused a decline to the capital. Set in Heian Period, it is a tale of an ex-servant who in a precarious situation of being left homeless after he was fired from a job. In order to survive the night of a stormy weather, he decided to take cover in the abandoned gates filled with corpses. He then encountered an old woman suspiciously prodding around the corpses.|This was fairly short with 7 pages long of we looking at the unnamed character and his actions and decisions in the moment. There is an internal struggle of choices between surviving but with a price to pay or died alongside the corpses. There is symbolism in here that subtly present though not obvious and I found it on a reread, they are much clearer. This one was a good introduction in this book and sets the pace of the book well. |2. Hell Screen|Yoshihide was known to be the best painter but with an ugly face and not an ounce of compassion to others with an exception of his daughter. When he is tasked to create a painting of Hell Screen by Lord Horikawa, a powerful authority whom coveted his talent but despised Yoshihide's unseemingly arrogant behaviour who thinks he is above others and his disrespect towards culture and religion, Yoshihide fell into the dark abyss of hell on earth. |This story depicted artistic obsession and dilemma similarly Akutagawa was towards his writing. Yoshihide is obssesed with his art and the only emotion of love he had was for his adolescent daughter, a compassionate and mild mannered girl. Yoshihide's passion towards art border into madness as he painted from observation and gained the picture by real life depiction rather than imagination such as rotting corpses and dreams of his encounter with the Hell Wardens.|His tendencies to paint real life depictions gave the authentic feeling to his painting but he sacrificed many things in order to reach the state. His sacrilegious behaviour torturing his apprentices indicate his manic tendencies to achieve perfection even go as far as the act of a devil. This story blew my mind. Its so briliantly written with introduction to characters, the peak of insanity, unexpected and twisted climax which ends on a depressing conclusion. A well crafted story that showed human's greed and jealousy can burns the world as if hell exists even in the real life. |3. In a Bamboo Grove|A reread. I have read this short story three times and it still remains vague and ambiguous on the actual truth. |The story questioned on how our memory can be unreliable and each persons had their own subjective experiences on seeing the same things thus giving different answers to one question. |It started with the testimony of a woodcutter then a travelling priest, a policeman and an old woman on the killing of a 26-year-old Kanazawa no Takehiro who found stabbed in a bamboo grove. We then get a confession from the killer, the wife of Takehiro Masago and in the end, the spirit's confession himself through a medium. What really interest me was the fact all 3 people involved in this incident had different stories showed that they either embelish or exaggerate their stories according to their own principles. One in anger, another for honour and lastly to subdue the shamefullness because of lust. Its an interesting take on how we convey our words in order to make it look differently from others.|In the end, we don't know the absolute truth as we can only relies on the statements and confession given by the witnesses and suspect as each person gave their words according to their own advantage either to save honour or cover for others. It was left to our own interpretation.|TW: sexual assault, physical assault, animal cruelty, arson, suicide|The second section of the book titled Under the Sword comprised of 3 stories: Dr Ogata Ryosai's Memorandum, O-gin and Loyalty. |In this section, the stories mostly based during the period of rules by Tokugawa shogun. Tokugawa ruled the country with power and force in fear of any rebellion and being overthrown. This time, the fear or threat from Christianity religion which is starting to make an impact on the people, Tokugawa was afraid of this thus there are punishment and execution for those who practiced the faith. |4. Dr Ogata Ryosai's memorandum ( 1916)|Following the memorandum of Doctor Ogata, this reports on a widow named Shino who has a young daugther that fallen ill. She was a practising Kirishitan or Christian thus causing her to be abhored and pushed away from the neighbours. In desperate need for help, she seeks Dr Ogata to see her daughter's sickly state but due to her religion, the doctor refused unless she abandoned the faith. |Interestingly, this story pit religion and family together. Its a story that shows the choice between keeping your religion or choose your flesh and blood. Certainly, its a notion that is cruel but soon we will see what fate arrived to Shino as she decided on her own as she was pushed to commit an unwilling act for her daughter. In the end, there is a twist of fate and it may seems unbelievable but a miracle do occur.|5. O-gin|Opposite to the miracle in the earlier story, this one questioned the choice make by the character. O-gin is an orphan girl who lost both of her parents at young age and she was adopted by a couple who are Christian though not many people know about it. They however were caught by the Satan and brought to the magistrate for cruel punishment and forced to denounce their faith. At the time of execution, O-gin decision to back away from Christian crumbles down as she realized she can never go to Heaven and abandon her birth parents whom she believed are in the depths of Hell.|This story made me think a lot on the choice of religion and family again. Being loyal to the religion in here meaning you are abandoning your family but O-gin decided to not be selfish and instead chose her parents. Its a debate of choice and weighing the importance of these two things in life. This will make an interesting discussion.|TW: murder, decapitation, graphic violence|6. Loyalty|This is fascinating as the terms loyalty coined to the person served to a bloodline. In here, we see a head of a household, a samurai started to have fits and nervous breakdown that ultimately led him being out of boundary and potentially harming the family's name. The Elder of the House decided that the master should refrain himself from attending any events that take place in the castle in fear of him embarassing or bring disgrace to the family. The elder is more loyal to serve the house than his own master thus lead to him being almost killed but instead he left the house, no longer want to serve the family. The next elder appointed is more accustomed or acquaintard with the house master as he seen him grew up and here, he is more loyal to the master than the house itself. So you see there is a different loyalty in the same household. There is a disatrous event occured after the master decision to go to the castle for last time before he retired causing the destruction of his whole bloodline. |Around this time, Akutagawa himself seems to be having his own nervous breakdown. This story may reflected his own mental state as the main character seems to fear almost everything and lashed out whenever something ticks him. |7. The story of the head that fell off |Set in the backdrop of Sino-Japanese War where tension is rising between China and Japan, war destroyed many people. Xiao-er, a chinese man went to a fight with Japanese cavalrymen and as he clash swords with them, he felt a sword hit his neck and then he ran away atop of his horse to flee from the dire situation. He fell from the horse, on the verge of his death, his past life started to passed by him in shapes of the clouds, his mother's apron, the field of his home, the foot of a woman he loved and the festival he attended. Slowly, he startdd to regret his past actions and want to live a better life. Soon after, a newspaper stated an accident of a human head falls off after a brawl in a diner. |This story was sort of a dark comedy/humor because there is a twisted ending of the man. Regrets came too late for him despite many things. In a way, this story showed that humans somehow will always make bad decision even though they always said they will do better next time.|7/9/2021|8. Green Onions|Interestingly, in here Akutagawa breaks the fourth wall and was present in the story by saying he need to complete this story in order to meet a deadline. It gave a slight humor although as always, there is something to be taken from the story itself. |O-Kimi, a beautiful young waitress in a cafe had fallen in love with a young charming Tanaka. O-Kimi had this childlike or romantic notion of love , potraying the ideal image of Tanaka but she also knows that he could not possibly be perfect. However, when someone is in love, they tend to put a rose tinted glasses on and admire the person so much, they will look past their lacking. When both of them are on a date, Tanaka harbours an ill intent that may occur if not for O-Kimi's attention diverted to green onions on display in the street neighbourhood. What exactly is the significance?|Simple as it is, she was awaken to the reality of economic and financial situation she was in after seeing the green onions' price. She was worried about her rents, next meal payments, and obligations in her life other than romantic relationship with Tanaka. There is a potential danger when Tanaka invited O-Kimi to a house they are supposed to go but this was stopped by his sight of her with the green onions on her arms. As if all intent vanished the moment he sees her that way. |9. Horse Legs|This is fascinating. Hanzaburo suddenly passed away but turns out, this was a mistake by the grim reapers and they eventually returned him back to the living world. However, here's the problem, Hanzaburo had died three days ago, his legs had start to become rotten and in order to cover this mistake, the grim reapers replaced his legs with horse legs. Hanzaburo was devastated and in order to conceal this hideous facts, he kept his legs in boots all the time and never let other people see his legs.|Content warning: Death, suicide, attempted suicide, affairs|10. Life of a Stupid Man|\\\"I am living now in the unhappiest happiness imaginable. Yet, strangely I have no regrets\\\" |\\\"I may wear the skin of an urbane sophisticate, but in this manuscript I invite you to strip it off and laugh at my stupidity\\\" |I almost cried just by reading these words. |This was my 3rd time reading this stories. Its an autobiographical stories comprised of 51 short anthologies or rather I would call it Akutagawa's musings on his life and principles. It was published posthumously after his death by his close friend. Attached to the manuscript was his letter to him which said he is entitled to release this stories but must not identify or put a names to the people he spoke about. |Cadavers|\\\"If I needed a corpse, I'd kill someone without the slightest malice. Of course, the reply stated where it was - inside his heart\\\"|Man-made wings|\\\"At twenty nine, life no ponger held any brightness for him, but Voltaire supplied him with man made wings. |\\\"The higher he flew, the farther below him sank joyd and sorrows of a lifr bathed in the light of intellect\\\"|We started with his descriptions of his mother whom he described as lunatic and whom he barely have any affection for but also afraid he becomes like her as he lives each days with fear. Then, we moved slowly as he grow to become a writer but pressured to concur with the writing industry, married to a woman he loves but end up in affairs, growing passion for arts and philosophy but also contradict most of them, become a father but felt he is useless and unsuitable and each time he muses on death and what does it mean to live. |The Birth|\\\"Why did this one have to be born - to come into the worls like all the others, this world so full of suffering?\\\" |Comic Puppet|\\\"He wanted to live life so intensely that he could die at any moment without regrets\\\"|Stuffed Swan (this particularly hits me the hardest)|\\\"As he thought about his life, he felt both tears and mockery welling up inside him. All that lay before him was madness or suicide\\\"|I couldn't put into words or make a proper dissection on this one because its personal and raw and basically him telling his own stories in the most vulnerable state he was in, secrets being unburied, darkest desires and emotions being poured out, philosophy shared and contradicted and generally him saying he is unable to be a man worth enough to live. Its quite painful in a away but subtly conveyed in each short passages he wrote. |Interestingly enough, he wrote these using third point of view as if it was another person but it was actually him. Maybe he tries to separate the creation he wrote about from his life but he knows so well it is him and will always be him. |11. Death Register|In here, we see his life in full lights with him describing the death of his insane mother, an elder sister he barely knew, and the father who left him when he was an infant but always tried to reconcile with him somehow. Akutagawa doesnt get love from his real parents but he was given plenty by his adoptive parents. This was poetic and lyrical piece of essay he wrotes on each of his family members and ones that I felt most attached to was his recall of his father's dying on his deathbed. Such a sad moment. The story ended with a haiku as went to visit the graves of his beloved, his thoughts of them dying as if they are fortunate enough to die rather than live.|12. Dragon: The Old Potter's Tale (1919)|- Similar to The Nose, this story also points out on appearance and religion where the Buddhist monk named E'in had a giant nose and this caused him to be the centre of jokes by many. In order to divert the attention from his looks, he concoct a revenge by putting a signboard saying that a dragon will ascend to heaven on the third month. The words spread around like wildfire, even if people had doubts, majority believed the news and soon anticipate the event. Eventually, the day come and thousand of people gather to see the dragon but does this dragon even exist?|The theme of religion and physical appearance were themes that Akutagawa explored most in his work and this one spark more interest in the question of whether the prank could actually be true. Jay Rubin mentioned \\\"Dragon\\u00a0toys with the likelihood that religion is nothing more than mass hysteria, a force so powerful that even the fabricator of an object of veneration can be taken in by it.\\\"\\u00a0|The question whether the dragon does ascend remain vague as we are unsure whether it exist or the people in the midst of waiting for hours too invested in the notion of wanting and believing the dragon, conjure up the image of dragon. Its fascinating but as always the ending remain inconclusive. |13. The Spider Thread (1918)|Its a very short story but concise in conveying the message. Talked about sinner's and how one act of compassion lead to a help from the lord above but a greed will cause the downfall. Kandata, a vicious murderer was punished in the lowest of Hells but his action of letting a spider live ultimately gave him a help to climb to heaven by the spider thread. There are depiction of gruesome hell and its a terrifying scene. For someone as selfish as Kandata who won't share his help from above with others eventually lead to his eternal damnation in Hell |An interesting twist of fate is that I was surprised that an anime Erased I just finished watching had a connection with this story I read yesterday. The anime talked about this short story and it was so twisted in the mind of a person and I was pleasantly surprised by the coincidence.|It was published for children based on Taisho fairy tales|14. Spinning Gears Verdant vignettes vibrate across the reader\\u2019s eyes, as the are drawn into the splendiferous similes which dance across the page, shimmering like the pale reflection of sun-light on pebbles in a Japanese garden. Akutagawa fused he aesthetics of haiku with the psychology of Dostoevsky and other Western writers; style and form are as central to his stories as structure, psychology and characters, yet few short story writers are able to match the sheer diversity of Akutagawa\\u2019s ouvre; whether it be Gogolian fantasy in \\u2018The Nose\\u2019, discourses on the power of art in \\u2018Hell Screen\\u2019 or proto magical realism in \\u2018Horse Legs\\u2019, the breadth of Akutagawa\\u2019s stories in immense.|The highlight of these stories is undoubtedly \\u2018Hell Screen\\u2019, a macabre exploration of the darker elements of artistic inspiration, as the titular character, the morose and morbid painter Yoshide, tortures others to gain inspiration for his depiction of hell. Other highlights include, \\u2018In a Budding Grove\\u2019 which explores the nature of narrative perspective and was the inspiration for Kurosawa\\u2019s \\u2018Rashomon\\u2019 and \\u2018Spinning Gears\\u2019 a playful and poetic l pieces which reminders the reader of the jejunish experimental fiction of Oulipo. |Interspersed within the short stories are some strikingly pretty images, such as;|\\u201cPine boughs stretched across the empty sky, and in them hung a copper-coloured moon devoid or radiance.\\u201d|\\u201cA butterfly fluttered it\\u2019s wings in a wind thick with the smell of seaweed. His dry lips felt the touch of the butterfly for the briefest instant, yet the wisp of a wing dust still shone on his lips years later.\\u201d|\\u201cI left the hotel and hurried towards my sister\\u2019s house along streets reflecting blue skys in pools of snow-melt\\u201d|Loneliness and alienation are the central themes which run through these stories, as the characters struggle to articulate their euphoria-whether it be religious in the exploration of incipient Christianity in \\u2018O-Gin\\u2019 (\\u201cO-Gin\\u2019s heart was not, like her parents, a desert swept by searing winds. It was an abundant field of ripened wheat sprinkled with wild roses\\u201d) or of the aspiring artist, Yasukichi, whose cloyingly clich\\u00e9d funeral orations are held in higher regards than his art. More than this, his stories are about love and disillusions and jjoys there is something quintessentially modern the urban romance in \\u2018Green Onions\\u2019. Akutagawa is, along with Chekhov and Katherine Mansfield, one of the greatest short story writers.  I would highly recommend this edition which has introductions by Haruki Murakami and translator Jay Rubin. Additional commentary and notes by Jay Rubin help you to understand background of stories. Akutagawa basically created many of his stories from ancient Japanese fables. However His autobiographical stories rely on theme of loneliness and death. I have found this theme in all other Japanese literature which I read. If you want to read Japanese literature then I think Akutagawa's name should be at top of your list. Japan's highest litaeture award is named after Him. |I got to know Ry\\u016bnosuke Akutagawa in 2014 because of art movie Ghost Dog : Way of The Samurai. Jim Jarmusch is one of my most favourite filmmaker and I absolutely devour His movies. The film borrows a lot of elements from French movie Le Samoura\\u00ef, Seijun Suzuki's Branded to Kill.|Just like central character of Le Samoura\\u00ef, Ghost Dog lives his criminal life with Samurai code. He is seen oftenly reading Hagakure by Yamamoto Tsunetomo and shows liking to Ry\\u016bnosuke Akutagawa's rashomon and recommends it to a minor character.  The stories included in this collection reflect an author who is intelligent, well-read, perceptive and deeply aware of human foibles. Half of the short stories are very entertaining and revealing, written in the cadences of ancient Eastern folk tales. |The author wrote these stories in the book in the years 1915 to 1925, in Japan, using Chinese and Japanese literary and cultural themes. But they not only educate the reader in the themes of Eastern literature, they also demonstrate that humanity is the same whether living in the East or West, no matter what century. The way people feel about the mysteries of their lives is the same whatever the setting. At the same time, the different, distinctly Eastern cultural prism through which our commonalities present themselves reflect a Japanese view in these stories that is a bit mystifying, and very interesting. |This collection includes two very famous stories, \\u2018Rashomon\\u2019 and \\u2018In a Bamboo Grove\\u2019, which were combined together into the plot of a famous Japanese movie, which in turn Hollywood has not so aptly attempted to imitate in several variations. A character\\u2019s character in point of view is certainly shown to be important in deciding veracity of a tale! |For the record, in the story Rashomon I believe the ghost, Tekehiro, is the most truthful. I believe he incorrectly reads his wife's actions and motivations, but he was the most truthful as he understood what happened.|Tekehiro\\u2019s wife, Masago, saw in Tekehiro what she interpreted as contempt in his face after she was raped. I believe she misread her husband's emotion. She saw what she feared most. She continuously lost consciousness and was extremely stressed. She had been raped, after all. Tajomaru, the rapist, was also a braggart and a criminal. He probably did not feel he would be let go or considered innocent after his capture by authorities. He would be most interested in inflating his actions, so I don't believe him in that there was a fight between him and Tekehiro. |After raping her, Tajomaru, I think, added insult to injury and tormented Masago, only increasing her distress and her certainty that her husband would despise her. In reality (?!?), the thief only wanted to rape, torment and rob the couple. Masago would have been wild with shame and fear of rejection by her husband, as well as feeling hopeless in having been degraded. |Tekehiro would have been dishonored and shamed by his impotence, greed, dupability and perhaps his suspicion that his wife lost respect for him. This would lead him to believe she could easily want him dead for that, and thus he would be blind to how she might be hiding her own shameful acts of wanting to save her life and honor by going with the thief, whom she believed wanted to take her with him (I think that's what he whispered to her in the short story). |The thief forced her to publicize her choice of living over loyalty, so, by his trick, she shamed herself twice over by her choice of deserting her husband. When the thief revealed his trick, she was triply humiliated - first the rape, and then her choice of deserting her husband, then in being fooled and rejected. After the thief left (why would he untie the husband, realistically?) I think, unable to face her wretched self-betrayal and afraid of her husband's supposed need for revenge and rage, she did try to stab him, but perhaps incompetently. She was 19, a young girl. After she ran away, her husband killed himself in self-loathing. The girl's mom said he was kind at heart, and he was a man of honor. At least that's how it makes sense to me, given what I know of human nature.|Of course, uncertain narrators abound, so what all of us judges can go by is what we know of human nature along with the testimony. Akutagawa has made the reader one of the characters in the story, has he not? As judges, truth must be assigned as a probability instead of a certainty. Although I believe in my above synopsis as the closest truth, Tajomaru confessed. I believe he raped and robbed and played a horrible spiteful trick on the couple which doomed the marriage, but as a judge, I don't believe he dueled or killed the husband physically. Tajomaru committed soul murders on the couple, perhaps. But Tajomuro has confessed out of misplaced pride and braggedo, and I'm happy to condemn him for the murder, given no other physical evidence.|The author is so clever. Now WE know the uncertainty of determining truth of phenomena which is dependent on human interpretations of reality. I have become an unreliable narrator.|I completely disbelieve the Woodcutter. Despite appearances of being disinterested, his story does not make any sense unless you accept the complete dissonance of a young wife being more like a hardened psychopathic prostitute moments after being abducted, imprisoned, and raped, by an armed man threatening death and humiliation. |Later stories included in the book, from 1925 to 1927 are more autobiographical or personal, and while revealing how similar that people feel about fear, stress, anxiety, and how we live within communal society, sadly, these somewhat autobiographical stories show how the author is losing his equilibrium and peace of mind. It is difficult to parse out if it is the fear of going insane or if it is actual instability precipitating the author\\u2019s emotional frailty. When I read my first Murakami, a compilation of short stories called \\\"After the Quake,\\\" I was amazed by his refreshing originality. Some of his stories, indeed, had the effect of an earthquake to me. There were jolting, sudden and unexpected turns. In one, a man and a woman, after a brief introduction, make love. Then, out of nowhere, the man felt a sudden impulse to kill her. In another story, the characters were on a beach. Tears suddenly flow down from the eyes of one character, then they talk of killing themselves. Developments like these come without warning as they were not even hinted in the previous narration.|Now, it can be told. This style of storytelling is not at all original. Murakami, I think, copied it from this great Japanese writer who killed himself in 1927 at the age of 35--Ryunosuke Akutagawa (in the list of the 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die he's under letter \\\"R\\\"--a mistake, because his surname is Akutagawa, not Ryunosuke). By his own confession, Murakami has been reading Akutagawa since he was a teenager.|I bet that if one includes Rashomon in that compilation \\\"After the Quake\\\" an uninitiated reader will not find any difference between it and the rest of the stories there except that the latter have modern settings while \\\"Rashomon\\\" is set in 12th century Japan.|\\\"Rashomon\\\" (\\\"Mon\\\" being the Japanese for gate) was an outer castle gate, specifically the great southern main entrance to Kyoto during the Heian Period. It had massive pillars, towering archways and several chambers. The whole city of Kyoto, at the time of the story, was under civil unrest. People were hungry, even the Rashomon itself had become dilapidated for lack of proper maintenance. In the upper chamber thereof was dumped the city's dead, the victims of the prevailing hunger and violence.|In the lower chamber sits a servant who had just lost his job. He is said to be waiting for the rain to stop but he knows that even if the rain stops he really has nowhere to go and nothing to do. He had come to the dreadful conclusion that he would either die of starvation or survive by being a thief.|The mood is somber, the descriptive prose is elegant, fluid and spontaneous. Just like Murakami (in his short stories). Then the servant sees something...Thereafter comes one event after another which felt like Murakami's earthquakes, with a similar ending that leaves unanswered questions.|In the Introduction to the life and works of Akutagawa a Japanese literary critic, in 1917, described him (Akutagawa) as \\\"a writer who can't write without props.\\\" I was amused by this because elsewhere in goodreads before, discussing Kafka on the Shore with a Murakami fanatic K.D., I wrote that Murakami had used a lot of juvenile, ineffective props here (like talking cats, mother and son fucking, eels falling down from the sky, etc.) which were not even original as you can see parallels from Greek mythology and even in works of Lewis Carroll. |The Introduction also declared:|\\\"Sheer technique...though skillfully applied, does not necessarily translate into original literature. A fictional world that was not truly (the author's) own and that used borrowed containers would eventually reach and impasse and come to stand in his way like a high wall. Further pursuit of fictional method could only yield technical polish. And not surprisingly, the novelty would wear thin and readers would tire of seeing the same devices.\\\"|Wow, I myself could have said this after reading Kafka on the Shore! Now, guess who wrote this introduction? Close your eyes and bang your head on the wall--Haruki Murakami himself.|LOL! In his (undated ... perhaps 2006?) introduction, Haruki Murakami gives us what he thinks would be Japan's 10 most important \\\"writers of national stature\\\". They are writers that \\\"left us works of the first rank that vividly reflect the mentality of the Japanese people ... [the works] must have the power to survive at least a quarter century after the writer's death. ... The important thing is whether each of them as an individual human being embraced an awareness of the great questions of the age, accepted his or her social responsibility as an artist on the front line, and made an honest effort to shape his or her life accordingly.\\\"|Haruki believes the top 10 to be:|#1. |S\\u014dseki Natsume|. Equal #2 are: 2.|Akutagawa Ry\\u016bnosuke|, 2.|\\u014cgai Mori|, 4.|Shimazaki To son|, 5.|Shiga Naoya|, 6.|Jun'ichir\\u014d Tanizaki|, 7.|Yasunari Kawabata|. Equal #8 are: 8.|Osamu Dazai|, 8.|Yukio Mishima|.|He can't think of a tenth name for the list(!). Which is cute if you are a fan of |Kenzabur\\u014d \\u014ce|. Haruki is such a bitch. He goes on to say that \\\"Kawabata's works, to be honest, have always been a problem for me. ... I have never been able to identify very closely with his fictional world.\\\" And \\\"With reagrd to Shimazaki and Shiga, I can only say that I have no particular interest in them ... what I have read has left little trace in my memory.\\\"|So old Kenzaburo has been excluded from Haruki's list of 10 ... which only includes 9 ... and of which, 3 he really doesn't have time for? Ouch.|But Haruki's obviously mad. He seems to say that |Botchan| can be \\\"memorized whole by most school children\\\". What?|On to Akutagawa ... I liked the \\\"I\\\" stuff the best. [3.25 stars]|Akutagawa's short stories are so engaging, and his use of words is very thoughtful. Some of them are very humorous, and the others havs poignant social messages. |Haruki Murakami, who wrote an introduction for this book, says, |\\\"The flow of his language is the best feature of Akutagawa's style. Never stagnant, it moves along like a living thing. His choice of words is intuitive, natural-and beautiful.\\\"|The titular story, Rash\\u014dmon, is an exquisite work which shows how morality could be at odds with the need for survival. It is very profound. |Other stories which I liked include:|\\u2022\\\"The Bamboo Grove\\\" (which I'd read and reviewed separately much earlier)|\\u2022\\\"The Nose\\\", a satire on public perception of one's appearance |\\u2022\\\"The Hell Screen\\\", a shocking story about a painter who goes insane in the process of finishing his magnum opus (a piece showcasing what hell would be like) and allows his innocent daughter to be set on flames in order to further the realistic nature of his art. |\\\"I could have sworn that the man's eyes were no longer watching his daughter dying in agony, that instead the gorgeous colors of flames and the sight of a woman suffering in them were giving him joy beyond measure.\\\"|\\u2022\\\"Dr. Ogata Ry\\u014dsai: Memorandum\\\" and \\\"O-Gin\\\" showed the early days of Christianity in Japan, and how followers of that sect were at odds with the other people around them and with the hostile government, as their faith is challenged at every turn. These were very interesting to read. |\\u2022\\\"The Story of a Head That Fell Off\\\" is a Chinese story depicting the horrors of war, and the people who fight those wars. |\\\"Xiao-er was overcome by a mysterious loneliness such as he had never experienced before. The vast blue sky hung above him in silence. People had no choice but to go on living their pitiful lives beneath that sky, buffeted by the winds that blow down from above. What loneliness! And how strange, he thought, that he had never known this loneliness until now.\\\"|\\u2022\\\"Horse Legs\\\" is arguably the most humorous story in this collection. It has a sardonic and tongue-in-cheek tone throughout. A newspaper article that comes out after the protagonist goes mad and runs away from home states, |\\\" What we would like to ask, however, is not \\\"What is the name of Mr. Oshino's malady?\\\" but rather \\\"What is Mr. Oshino's responsibility to his wife?\\\" Like an unblemished golden jar, our glorious National Essence stands upon a foundation of belief in the family. We need not ask, then, how grave the responsibilities of the head of any one family might be. Does the head of a family have the right to go mad any time he feels like it? To this question we must offer a resounding \\\"No!\\\" |Imagine what would happen if the husbands of the world suddenly acquired the right to go mad. All, without exception, would leave their families behind for a happy life of song on the road, or wandering over hill and dale, or being kept well fed and clothed in an insane asylum. Then our 1,000-year-old belief in the family \\u2014 our very pride in the eyes of the world \\u2014 could not fail to collapse. We are not, of course, urging that Mr. Oshino be treated harshly. We must, however, loudly beat the drum to condemn his rash crime of having gone mad. No, let this not be limited to Mr. Oshino's crime alone. We must also condemn the utter misfeasance of successive administrations for having neglected our urgent need for a law prohibiting insanity.\\\"|I did not enjoy the supposed autobiographical section called \\\"Akutagawa's Own Story\\\" as much as I did his fiction. They had their moments, but were overall quite tedious to read.|Daidoji Shinsuke explores his childhood and school, with the narrator being a self-proclaimed intellectual. \\\"Death Register\\\" talks about his estranged, insane mother, an elder sister he never got to know, and his father who relinquished him as a baby. \\\"The Life of a Stupid Man,\\\" and \\\"Spinning Gears\\\" both show Akutagawa probing the meaning of the life he has led to that point, and moving ever closer to death. |* |Notes for myself|\\u2022 |Akutagawa's mental illnesses and their impact on his work|\\\"We will never know for certain whether the neuroses from which he suffered later in life were caused by hereditary factors, mental instability, or his latent fears, but sickness of mind casts a heavy shadow on the late stories and would end up taking his life. Surely it would be no exaggeration to say that writing these late works effectively shortened his life, but it is also true that he was unable to find a way to go on living as a writer without writing works of this nature-and once he could no longer live as a writer, his life would cease to have meaning. It well could be that Akutagawa had to turn to the world of storytelling and technique in order to find refuge from his dark heredity. Rather than face the real world, so full of terror and pain, he might have transported himself mind and body into another world in hopes of finding a kind of salvation in its fictionality.\\\"|\\u2022|Akutagawa's position in Japanese literary history, as given by Murakami| \\\"Perhaps the true reason that Akutagawa Ryunosuke continues to be read and admired today as a \\\"national writer\\\" lies in this in the realization and determination that effectively pushed him into a dead end. He started out as one of the chosen few: a Japanese intellectual with a consciousness torn between the West and Japan's traditional culture, in the border regions of which he succeeded in erecting a uniquely vigorous world of story. As he matured, he attempted to fuse the two different cultures inside himself at a higher level. He attempted structurally to combine the distinctively Japanese style of the I-novel with his own elegant fictional method. He hoped, in other words, to pioneer a newer, more uniquely Japanese form of serious literature. But this would have required a strenuous, long-term effort that his hypersensitive nerves and delicate con- stitution could not sustain. Pursued by the dark visions that crawled out of the gloom, he would finally despair and cut his life short. Akutagawa's terrible suicide administered a great shock to the minds of his contemporaries. It signaled both the defeat of a member of the intellectual elite and a major turning point in history.|Many Japanese would see in the death of this one writer the triumph, the aestheticism, the anguish, and the unavoidable downfall of the Taish\\u014d Period's cultivated elite. His individual declaration of defeat also became a signpost on the road of history leading to the tragedy of the Second World War. In the period just before and after his death, the flower of democracy that had bloomed with such promise in the Taisho Period simply shriveled and died. Soon the boots of the military would resound everywhere. The writer Akutagawa Ryunosuke stands as an illuminating presence in the history of Japanese literature, a symbol of his age's brief glory and quiet defeat.\\\"|\\u2022|The role of a writer in the contemporary globalized world|\\\"Today, when the world is growing ever smaller through the spectacular development of the Internet and the increasingly rapid flow of economic interchange, we find ourselves in a pressing situation whereby, like it or not, our very survival depends on our ability to exchange cultural methodologies on an equivalent basis. To turn toward a stance of national exclusivity, regionalism, or fundamentalism in which nations become isolated politically, economically, culturally, or religiously could bring about unimaginable dangers on a worldwide scale. If only in that sense, we novelists and other creative individuals must simultaneously broadcast our cultural messages outward and be flexible receptors of what comes to us from abroad. Even as we unwaveringly preserve our own identity, we must exchange that which can be exchanged and understand that which can be mutually understood. Our role is perfectly clear.\\\" It\\u2019s hard to review something like Ry\\u016bnosuke Akutagawa\\u2019s | Rash\\u014dmon and Seventeen Other Stories|: it\\u2019s too complex, too often inducing a |\\u201cWhat was that I read?\\u201d|, too deep, and yet approachable, very readable. |I found this book by chance while surfing Goodreads, and was immediately attracted by | Rash\\u014dmon|, since I am a fan of Kurosawa\\u2019s, and am all admiration for that particular film (the plot of which, ironically, draws more from Akutagawa\\u2019s |In the Bamboo Grove| than it does from | Rash\\u014dmon| itself). I bought the book and told myself that I\\u2019d read it slowly, one short story at a time\\u2014and found myself caught like a fly in a spider\\u2019s web. I ended up reading most of this book in long stretches, until my eyes hurt. |The eighteen stories are very diverse in nature: there are ghosts here, and dragons. There is hell, both somewhat distant, seen through the benevolent eyes of the Sakyamuni in |The Spider Thread|, |and| close, horrifying, macabre\\u2014as in |Hell Screen|. There are tales of a Japan torn between tradition and modernity, of battles between Christianity and older, local beliefs. There are battles, too, between man and man, and\\u2014most forcibly, most searingly, the stories of man\\u2019s battles with himself. The latter are brought most vividly (and disturbingly) to life in the last section of the book, which brings together six autobiographical stories by Akutagawa. |As I progressed through this book, I went through a range of emotions. I laughed at the quirky humour in |The Nose, Dragon: The Old Potter\\u2019s Tale| and |Green Onions|. I shivered at the cruelty of |Hell Screen|. And I couldn\\u2019t help but wonder how much of |Spinning Gears| (which was published posthumously, after Akutagawa killed himself in 1927) was real, and how much was not. |This is a brilliant book. It\\u2019s rich, textured, detailed. The imagery is often breathtaking (\\u201c|She had a radiant face, like the morning sun on a thin sheet of ice\\u201d|), and the layers are fascinating, peeling away from the mundane, even comical, to the wryly profound. As an example: |\\u201dHe put a cigarette in his mouth and was striking a match when he collapsed face-down on his desk and died. It was a truly disappointing way to die. Fortunately, however, society rarely offers critical comment regarding the way a person dies. The way a person lives is what evokes criticism|.\\u201d|The translator, Jay Rubin, also provides useful notes on stories and their elements, which help in a better understanding of the story (especially for someone not familiar with Japan and its culture). In addition, there\\u2019s a brief but good biography of Akutagawa, and a superb introduction by Haruki Murakami. I would advise reading all of these, besides the stories that comprise the book: they help get a better insight into the author, and so add to the experience. |I ended this book feeling both oddly deflated |and| inspired. As a writer, I can\\u2019t help but be inspired by writing of such stature. As a writer, too, I can\\u2019t help but feel that I cannot possibly ever write as brilliantly as this. Not a book I am going to forget in a hurry, if ever.  I first came by Ry\\u016bnosuke Akutagawa via Akira Kurosawa\\u2019s 1950 film |Rash\\u014dmon|. It\\u2019s an adaptation of two short stories within this collection: \\u201cIn a Bamboo Grove\\u201d and \\u201cRash\\u014dmon\\u201d (though Kurosawa adapted the former and simply took the name of the latter and used it as a framing device). It\\u2019s one of my favorite Kurosawa films, and so I knew I\\u2019d like to check out the source material at some point. I\\u2019m glad I did, because there are some really good stories here and it\\u2019s an overall well-rounded anthology.|This collection is divided into four sections: A World in Decay, Under the Sword, Modern Tragicomedy, and Akutagawa's Own Story. Akutagawa crosses genres throughout these stories--from comedy to drama to autobiography to Jidaigeki to the Gothic--and a lot of them work out quite well. I\\u2019m a particular fan of \\u201cIn a Bamboo Grove,\\u201d \\u201cHell Screen,\\u201d \\u201cThe Nose,\\u201d \\u201cThe Spider Thread,\\u201d and \\u201cGreen Onions.\\u201d The autobiographical stories in the last section, while at times quite fascinating in learning about Akutagawa\\u2019s inner turmoil, don\\u2019t read as well as the previous stories; they\\u2019re interesting and informational, but they\\u2019re ultimately a little hard to get into and not as entertaining as the previous stories.|Akutagawa is a great writer. He oftentimes has some slick and inviting prose, which makes for easy and enjoyable reading. His well-placed comedic touches were surprising too. However, if you aren\\u2019t that educated on Japanese history and geography, like me, then you may struggle a bit with the references. There are extremely helpful note indications throughout, but that means flipping to the back of the book, which does disrupt the flow of reading. I\\u2019d definitely recommend this collection, but some might want to proceed with caution. This collection of short stories had no discernable connection or theme throughout. The stories were pretty different: some were fantastical/fairytale-like, with spirits and gods etc.; others were realistic historical fiction. The realistic ones were also pretty varied: some featured real historical figures, like poets, artists and politicians; others were populated by completely fictional characters. Some were set in ancient times, some in medieval, some in XVII, XVIII, XIX centuries. |Jumping between these entirely different tones and settings felt jarring|.|There were a |few stories I thought were brilliant|, moving or enjoyable. One of them, in particular, was about |Matsuo Bash\\u014d|, made me want to pick up a collection of his haikus. |But for at least a |half of the book or more, I was bored and struggled| through unknown words, things and concepts, spirits and historical figures which carried no meaning for me, character/plot arcs that I didn't get.\",\n          \"I had a predisposition to like this, as I enjoy Sir Walter Scott, and I also read and enjoyed Maturin's \\\"Melmoth the Wanderer\\\" some years ago. In fact, this was such enjoyable escapism that I think I got more pleasure from it than any other book I've read this year so far. It helps that I have always felt more at home in the 13th century than the 21st. This is a magnificent blend of Gothic fantasy: battles, jousts, sieges, damsels in distress, wise hermits, evil witches, corrupt ecclesiastics - even werewolves...with plenty of comedy to leaven the horror, and some bromance to leaven the courtly love of knights for maidens. Some of the physical description, such as of the bandit castle by the sea, left me vertiginously intoxicated. I was there, torchlight flickering as I climbed the stone spiral staircase, damp exhalations from the dungeons beneath, looking out over the battlements on a wild and stormy sea under the star crossed sky...|Are there faults? Only if you dislike this sort of thing. If you know nothing of the historical background, are not familiar with the Bible, and have no Latin, then it would be very confusing. One of the comic themes is the relationship between two worldly prelates, the battle-axe-wielding Bishop of Toulouse and the wine-bibbing Abbot of Normoutier. The bishop's disdain for the latter is founded on the Abbot's frequent mangling of his Latin quips and descent into \\\"dog\\\" Latin. I think I missed a lot of the wittier and more abstruse puns, but then as a schoolboy my Latin compositions were often disfigured by my Latin master drawing a lamppost in the margin of my exercise book, signifying that my efforts were mere \\\"dog\\\" Latin themselves. |Nevertheless this is a tightly plotted page-turner and I was sorry when it came to an end.

But that still left more than 1,400 others - and not a page too long.| Maturin, as an Irish Anglican priest, experienced bigotry and sectarianism at first hand. The ending is conventional in that we get happy marriages all round, but perhaps not so conventional in that the context is one of happy ecumenism and the healing of apparently irreconcilable religious difference through the solvent of love and friendship.

They allege, and with some justification, that ever since the world began, although we may have no way of knowing when it began, there has never been an effect without a cause, and every cause, whether because pre-ordained or by some simple mechanism, has brought about and will go on bringing about some effect or other, which, let it be said, is produced instantly, although the transition from cause to effect may have escaped the observer or only come to be more or less reconstituted much later.|Jos\\u00e9 Saramago| wrote this novel also to illustrate such complex and nonlinear causality.|But there is more to it, |The History of the Siege of Lisbon| is as well the history of the siege of the female heart\\u2026|It would not take much learning to observe, as much today as in those medieval times, despite the Church\\u2019s disapproval of classical similes, how Eros and Thanatos were paired off\\u2026|Both cities and female hearts must be conquered by siege.

In the glowing light of the day and in the rosy spirit of the present calendar week (romance in the air...) I am overwhelmed with positive emotions and declare my ever-growing admiration and respect towards the great Portuguese writer Jos\\u00e9 Saramago (1922-2010) and his golden legacy in terms of his well-known controversial, challenging, and thought-provoking novels. |I am completely and irrevocably absorbed into his works. I am jumping like a mosquito from one book to another, in a very ambitious attempt to read as much as possible, but of course I am not able to because I feel I am not grasping as much as I need in this frenzy and hectic pace, so I take one step or even two back and start anew. |I think I even firmly established my aim when reading Jose Saramago which is: to rediscover the importance and beauty of questioning; to refresh my personal writing style to the level of being able to communicate (verbally and in written) using a vocabulary that is full of savor and rhythm, as if it were not something outside the language, but intrinsic. This is a language like an uninterrupted flow, like a river, a large mass of water that slips heavy, shining, with fast forward rhythm, even if, occasionally, its course is interrupted by cataracts. I have no fear whatsoever (although pragmatically I fear water because of lack of swimming skills) to get immersed fully in this best prose (in my mind\\u2019s eyes) and to disappear there for a few days, weeks, months...maybe couple of years\\ud83d\\ude0a|The History of the Siege of Lisbon treats, within parallel plots [one set in the twelfth century, describing some key episodes of the \\u2018alternative\\u2019 history of the siege of Lisbon, which our hero Raimundo Silva is asked to write; and, the other, in the twentieth century, showing the day to day routine of our proof-reader\\u2019s existence and, of course, the very important destiny encounter with a new editor who becomes his trigger for a new life\\u2026] an important aspect of speculating between historiography, historical novels and \\u201cstories inserted into history\\u201d, which seem the type of book that Saramago himself prefers to write, in the end history and fiction constantly overlap, or in Saramago\\u2019s own words: \\u201cThe truth is that history could have been written in many different ways and this idea of infinitude and variation are the essence of my writing.

In the serie of books I've read so far (luckily it seems I followed intuitively a perfect sequence, starting with Baltasar and Blimunda and then The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis), this is number 3 novel actor, and it has had an extensively positive impact over me. Could be due to number 3 magic properties. I relish 3 and any multiples of it, including number 7.|And from here on-wards I give the word to the great voice of Saramago, this being a block of text that I have had lots of fun reading it \\ud83d\\ude0a\\ud83d\\ude0a\\ud83d\\ude0a reminding me of myself.|\\u226a \\u2026Raimundo Silva must have whispered a similar plea [may God protect all of us, for we are fighting in His name], transposed into the first person singular, as he set about dialing the number of his destiny, but in a whisper so low that it scarcely passed his lips, a plea as tremulous as that of any adolescent, he himself now has more food for thought, if he thinks, whether his body is not simply one huge kettledrum where the bell of the telephone rings and rings, not the bell, the electronic signal, awaiting the sudden interruption of the call, and a voice that says, Speaking, or, What can I do for you, perhaps Hello, perhaps Who\\u2019s calling, there is no lack of possibilities amongst the conventional phrase and their modern variants, however, dazed as he was, Raimundo Silva was unable to hear what was being said, only that it was a woman speaking, so he asked disregarding any niceties, Is that Dr Maria Sara, no, it was not, Who\\u2019s speaking, it was as if Raimundo Silva wanted to know his editor\\u2019s voice, this was not a truth beyond question, but served as a simple form of identification, we are certainly not going to suggest that he introduced himself as Raimundo Benvindo Silva, proof-reader, working for the same publishing house, and even if he had, the reply would have been the same, Wait a moment, please, I\\u2019ll see if Dr Maria Sara can take your call, never had a moment been so brief, Don\\u2019t ring off, I\\u2019m carrying the telephone through, then silence. |\\u2026How are you, her voice taking him by surprise, Raimundo Silva, has expected to hear the maid say something more, such as, I\\u2019m passing the telephone to Dr Sara, that would have meant a further postponement of three or four seconds, but instead this direct question, How are you, reversing the situation, for surely it was up to him to express interest in her state of health, I\\u2019m fine, thank you, and quickly added, I wanted to know if you\\u2019re feeling better, How did you know I\\u2019ve been ill, At the office, When, Yesterday forenoon, So you decided to ring to see how I am, Yes, Many thanks for being so thoughtful, you\\u2019re the only proof-reader to have shown any interest, Well, I felt I had to, I hope I haven\\u2019t disturbed you, On the contrary, I\\u2019m deeply grateful, I\\u2019m feeling better, I think probably tomorrow or the day after, I\\u2019ll be back at the office, Well, I mustn\\u2019t tire you, I wish you a speedy recovery, Just before you ring off, how did you find my telephone number, Young Sara gave it to me, Ah, the other Sara, Yes, the telephonist, When, As I told you, yesterday forenoon, And you waited until today to call me, I was afraid of disturbing you, But you overcome your fear, I suppose so, otherwise I wouldn\\u2019t be speaking to you right now, Meantime, you should have been told that I wanted to speak to you. For two seconds, Raimundo Silva thought of pretending that he had not received the message, but before the third second passed, he found himself answering, Yes, Therefore I can assume that you couldn\\u2019t help calling me once I had taken the initiative, You may assume what you please, that\\u2019s up to you, but you must also assume that if I asked the telephonist for your number it wasn\\u2019t just to carry it around in my pocket, waiting for who knows what, there was another reason, What, Simply a lack of courage, Your courage appears to have been limited to that little proof-reading episode you don\\u2019t like me mentioning, In fact, I\\u2019m only telephoning to inquire about your state of health and to say I\\u2019ll hope you\\u2019ll soon be better, And don\\u2019t you think it\\u2019s time you asked me why I called you, Why did you call me, I\\u2019m not sure that I like your tone of voice, Words are more important than the way they\\u2019re spoken, I would have assumed that your experience as a proof-reader must have taught you that words mean nothing unless spoken in a certain tone of voice, The written word is mute, Reading gives it a voice, Except when read in silence, Even then, unless Senhor Raimundo Silva believes the brain is a silent organ, I\\u2019m only a proof-reader, like the shoemaker, I make do with carpet-slippers, my brain knows me, I know nothing about my brain, An interesting observation, You still haven\\u2019t answered my question, What question, Why did you telephone me, I\\u2019m no longer certain that I feel like telling you, So, I\\u2019m not the only coward, I don\\u2019t recall having said anything about cowardice, You spoke about a lack of courage, That\\u2019s not the same thing, The two sides of a coin are different, but the coin is one and the same, Valour is only to be found on one side, This conversation is getting beyond me and I suggest we drop the subject, besides it\\u2019s most unwise to argue like this, given your state of health, This cynicism doesn\\u2019t become you, I\\u2019m not being cynical, I know, so stop pretending, Seriously, I don\\u2019t think we know what we\\u2019re talking about, Speak for yourself, Then explain it to me, There\\u2019s no need for any explanations, You\\u2019re evading the question, It\\u2019s you who are evading the question, your\\u2019re hiding from yourself and want me to tell you what you already know, Please, Please what, I think we ought to ring off, this conversation has got out of hand, You\\u2019re to blame, Me, Yes, you, You\\u2019re much mistaken, I like things to be clear, Then try being clear and tell me why you are so aggressive whenever you speak to me, I\\u2019m never aggressive with anyone, I don\\u2019t have this modern vice, Then why are you aggressive with me, It isn\\u2019t true, Since the first day we met, should you need reminding, Circumstances, But those circumstances have changed yet you\\u2019re gone on being aggressive, Forgive me, that was never my intention, Now it\\u2019s my turn to ask you not to use such meaningless words, Agreed, I\\u2019ll say no more, Then listen, I telephoned you because I was feeling lonely,, because I was curious to know if you were working, because I wanted you to take an interest in my health, because, Maria Sara, Don\\u2019t say my name like that, Maria Sara, I like you, a long pause, Is that so, It\\u2019s the truth, You took your sweet time before telling me, And perhaps I might never have got round to telling you, Why not, We\\u2019re different, we belong to different worlds, What do you know about all these differences between us and our worlds, I can guess, observe, draw my own conclusions, These three operations can just as easily lead us to draw the right or the wrong conclusions, Agreed, and my biggest mistake right now is to have confessed that I like you, Why, Because I know nothing about your private life, whether you are, Married, Yes, or, In any way spoken for, to use an old-fashioned expression, Yes, Well, let\\u2019s imagine that I am already married or engaged, would that prevent you from being fond of me, No, And if I really were married or engaged to someone else, should that prevent me from being fond of you, if that was how I felt, I don\\u2019t know, Then you should know that I am fond of you, a long pause, Is that true, Yes, it\\u2019s true, Listen Maria Sara, Tell me, Raimundo, but first you should know that I got divorced three years ago, that I ended an affair three months ago and haven\\u2019t had any more affairs since, that I have no children but would dearly love to have them, I live with a married brother, and the person who answered the telephone was my sister-in-law, and you don\\u2019t have to tell me who took down my message, she\\u2019s your cleaner, and now, Mr Proof-reader, you may speak, pay no attention to this wild outburst, it\\u2019s that I\\u2019m brimming over with joy, Tell me, why do you like me, What can I say, I just like you, And aren\\u2019t you afraid that once you get to know me, you won\\u2019t like me anymore, It sometimes happens, in fact, it happens quite a lot, So, So, nothing, it takes time to get to know each other, I like you, I believe you, When can we see each other, As soon as I can get up from this bed of pain, Where\\u2019s the pain, All over, What is actually wrong with you, Nothing serious, or rather, the worst flu I\\u2019ve ever experienced, From where you are, you can\\u2019t see me, but I\\u2019m smiling, Now that\\u2019s really something, I don\\u2019t believe I\\u2019ve ever seen a smile cross your lips, Can I confide that I love you, No, simply say that you are fond of me, I\\u2019ve already said so, Then keep the rest for the day you truly love me, should that day ever come, It will come, Let\\u2019s not bank on the future, better to wait and see what it has in store for us, and now this weak, feverish woman asks to be left in peace to rest, to recover her strength in case it occurs to someone to call back again today, To speak to you, Or you, for the phrase could just as easily refer to either of us, Ambiguity isn\\u2019t always a defect, So long, Let me leave you with a kiss, The time will come for kisses, For me it has been slow in coming, One last question, Tell me, Have you started to write your \\u2018History of the Siege of Lisbon\\u2019, Yes, I have, Good, for I\\u2019m not sure that I could have gone on liking you if you\\u2019d said no, Goodbye. \\u2026\\u226b|NB: Saramago acknowledged in an article that there is a lot of him in the protagonist of the novel, Raimundo Silva, a middle-aged, isolated proofreader who falls in love with his boss, an attractive, younger editor who 'saves' him from emotional mediocrity. The novel is dedicated to his wife (as are all his subsequent books), the Spanish journalist Pilar del Rio, whom he married in 1988. In other words, this is a '...and they lived happily ever after' tale. Jose Saramago may not somebody who relies so heavily on plot. He utilizes stream-of-consciousness in \\\"The History of the Siege of Lisbon\\\" as a way to merge the history of the city\\u2019s past with that of the protagonist living out his life in the modern day. In the novel, conversations bear no quotations, no parentheses appear on added-on ideas/non sequiturs, nor are questions accompanied by a ?. Whole paragraphs are pages long, & it's safe to say that most of them contain a single action or noun which is then fully explored for the remainder of that paragraph: each minutiae is meticulously explained and more questions (plenty of the hypothetical kind) are added on to the subject in question. Also a heavy use of commas and lists is a way of penetrating truths in a deeper way. He's NOT MY KIND OF WRITER: he asks way too much of his readers, & one wonders what would happen if Saramago had SOMETHING going on, namely a STORY, & if he added all the flourishes that make him unique: THAT would truly grab me. |Here then (for my CONSCIOUSNESS & FICTION grad class) an attempt at a Saramagian yarn:| Montage|\\tLazaro has put on his contact lenses and is ready to get to work. Some saline solution still drips down the sides of his bright, bright eyes as he tidies up the bathroom a bit, dabbing the teeny puddles of water left on the rim of the faucet with the Kleenex he used previously to wipe the sides of his eyes, making perfect green vertical rectangles of the bath towels hanging on a chrome bar to his side, placing the half-empty bottle of solution, his eyeglasses which he won\\u2019t need anymore, and his contact case inside the mirror cabinet, then enters his room, his domain, his dark lair, sits still on his chair and exhales loudly. He hasn\\u2019t even looked at the posters which undoubtedly require, seek, his attention, which are the sole objects we must now devote our focus on. Let\\u2019s not look too much at this room, though there is a considerable plenty to contemplate here: books on the redwood shelf, A Confederacy of Dunces, The Corrections, White Teeth, The Secret History, The Rules of Attraction, The Blithedale Romance, all three Lord of the Rings plus The Hobbit, The Complete Short Stories of J. G. Ballard, Bel Canto, Candide, The Shining, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Senor Vivo and the Coca Lord and additionally a huge array of colors, thin and almost invisible, in the form of individual DVD titles, Titanic, Cool Hand Luke, Mulholland Drive, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Halloween, Sleeping Beauty, Fellini\\u2019s La Dolce Vita, Pink Flamingoes, Lost in Translation, Before Sunrise plus some smaller slits of color nearby which conform exactly to the shapes of CDs the colors white, red, black, blue, magenta, with titles given them by the artists responsible, just as writers themselves must give names to their peculiar rowdy offspring made of ink and paper, but these music artists are more important than the forgettable titles of their work, songs played in supersonic repetition by the likes of Pink Floyd, E.L.O., Dr. Dre, NIN, Philip Glass, Black Flag, Maria Daniela y su Sonido Lasser and Britney Spears. All this is too much to see all at once but a mixture of all these catalysts and inspiring cores exists in some indiscernible form within the brain of our Lazaro. There is however a vast difference between all the inspiration found in these artistic forms of the modern age, their sheer attainability is surreal, all these masterpieces, all this plot, image and sound in a micro museum at our protagonist\\u2019s disposal, his points of reference, & the posters which are laid down like grey corpses, spread out the full length of the desk. These are definitely unfinished, unpublished, unseen by the masses, and they are precisely this way because at this point Lazaro is barely getting the courage to move his drawing pencil in concentric circles, rightward, downward, then back up again as the snake eats up its tail, as this surely will bring something out. Maybe the knife should gleam only slightly, he thinks then, at its tip, and maybe the victim\\u2019s mouth will be the circles, which can become as small or as large as the artist imagines. And words. There will be a cryptic feel to this poster, this attempt at art, attempt at permanence, just as those others are there now, looking down at him with ambiguity from their shelves, maybe even with some jealousy, and the feeling will be inspired by everything he\\u2019s ever come into contact with. He takes some certain image from a book, from a film, from the lyrics of songs and tries to do something of it, he takes it within himself to rearrange it, chip at it, add some meat to it, change its entire significance. He starts committing the pencil to the noisy endless paper, begins to think calmly, letting things displace themselves like autumn leaves from his cranium. The montage then is too much to bear, this happens when Lazaro thinks way too much on a single muchness, on one singular complexity, because everything everything has been done one or two or millions of times before and nothing is ever quite original, but only the montage will bring out something that he would have otherwise kept to himself, inside himself, entombed, and it hurts. He has, some hours later, a blueprint, an essence and sure existence, since now it is there for all to see, for there it is for Lazaro to finish off, and he is incredibly happy on many levels, one being that he has not wasted his time after all, one below that that this may actually turn out to be something, something good, and in the basement level which states that leaving things internal is just so wrong that it could lead to something bad, an overload, like cancer. A delightful, mature and sensitive love story surrounded by a bizarre fictionalized narrative of the bloody and violent expulsion by Portuguese Christians of the Islamic Moors from Lisbon in 1174. A simple quiet 50 year old bachelor meets an attractive and successful 40 year old divorc\\u00e9. She likes him and politely seduces him. He likes her. They\\u2019re happy together. The intimacy of the bedroom scenes is touching and sincere. A beautiful feel good story oddly surrounded by hatred and death, but also accomplishment, as Lisbon does become Portuguese. Cool book. Fun to read. My new favorite Saramago. Five stars! 194.\\tHist\\u00f3ria do Cerco de Lisboa = The history of the siege of Lisbon, Jos\\u00e9 Saramago|The History of the Siege of Lisbon is a novel by Portuguese author Jos\\u00e9 Saramago, first published in 1989. Raimundo Silva, assigned to correct a book entitled \\\"The History of Siege of Lisbon\\\" by his publishing house, decides to alter the meaning of a crucial sentence by inserting the word \\\"not\\\" in the text, so that the book now claims that the Crusaders did not come to the aid of the Portuguese king in taking Lisbon from the Moors. This has repercussions both for himself and for the historical profession.

It shouldn't be a surprise, then, that a professional proofreader protagonist/narrator immediately compelled me and held my attention. The idiosyncratically minimalist punctuation and the pages-long comma-spliced sentences were so unbelievably perfect for me as a reader (and for this story) that i couldn't put it down despite the difficulties they presented for comprehension. Saramago was forcing me to read more carefully than when i was attempting to consume the entire science fiction canon in the mid-1990s.|Finally (for the time being anyway) i never would've thought that i could find so much enjoyment in what reasonably could be considered \\\"merely\\\" a love story. But let's not forget |Pride and Prejudice|. What history?|In 1147, Dom Afonso Henriques and his fellow Portuguese laid siege to the Moors who had occupied Lisbon. Known as the Reconquista, Christian armies including English, French, German and Spanish, were trying to win back land from the Muslims who had taken much of Iberia and Southern Europe since the 8th century. These foreign soldiers were known as the Crusaders.|What is history?|We know our history from historians and the books handed down to us over the centuries. We also know that history is written mostly by the victors. This helps nationalism develop in countries trying to define themselves. What we did in the past is what we shall become or hopefully avoid. Are these truths, stories, hearsay, or just passing accounts? |What are the facts?|What if an editor sought to change a word in a historical tract? A simple word. \\u201cN\\u00e3o\\u201d or No in English. A negative that defines what didn\\u2019t happen. Or what could have happened.|In the Saramago world, what if this editor, Raimundo Benvindo Silva claims that the Portuguese King didn\\u2019t ask the Crusaders for their help? What would be the outcome? Could the Portuguese do it on their own? Will that help their nationalism? And what of the losers, the Moors?|What does history say?|History is typically told from the view of the kings, leaders, their immediate followers and families. We don\\u2019t hear much about the common man. We don\\u2019t hear much about the other side. Except maybe in a novel, written by a certain Portuguese author.|What does love have to do with this?|The old tales of knights and their crusades were known as romances. Nothing like inserting a love story with the editor and his boss. Or how about a love story within the tales of the siege? Does it just come down to love and hate? War and peace? It all seems to fit. |What is real?|We weave ourselves into history. We are not bound by time but only by our desire to become part of our own simple history.|I leave this to Senhor Saramago to address this. \\u201cIn truth, I believe there is a great division of people who say yes or say no.\\u201d You decide. The story of Raimundo Silva, a proofreader, who acts on an impulse and by adding a \\u201cno\\u201d changes the content of a book and his life too. |Same long phrases, same existential questions, same irony and humor between the lines. Really missed his style. Literary fiction about a proofreader that significantly alters the meaning of a book by changing one word, such that his revised text states the crusaders did |NOT| help the Portuguese drive the Moors out of Lisbon in the year 1147. At the suggestion of his newly appointed supervisor, the proofreader then goes on to write his own version of |The History of the Siege of Lisbon,| using his altered text as a starting point. Since he lives in Lisbon, he can actually visit some of the locations where the Siege took place. The proofreader\\u2019s version of history is interspersed with his present-day narrative.|Saramago\\u2019s writing is lovely, but the meandering can be distracting. I often had to re-read sections to figure out where the initial thought started and how I ended up so far afield from that thought. He employs long sentences using only commas and periods. Dialogue is embedded in the prose, and there is no indication which character is speaking, so the reader will have to keep track mentally. The author does not differentiate between two story arcs, often moving between them within the same paragraph. There are long paragraphs describing a character\\u2019s internal dialogue (for example, of whether or not to make a phone call) that span several pages. The narrator goes off on many tangents, some of which are head-scratchers. In short, this book requires a great deal of patience and concentration. |I found I needed to understand more about Portuguese history to fully appreciate the storyline, so it took me a while to finish this book, since I was constantly looking up events and people that played a role in the actual Siege of Lisbon. Thus, I recommend getting an overview of the historical Siege, as well as the key players involved, before embarking on this novel. |I believe the point of this book is to show how fiction can impact the historical record. Participants often leave no written record of their thoughts and emotions, and Saramago explores whether we can truly understand the reasons behind why people acted the way they did after many years have passed. |I have read two other books by Saramago, |Blindness| and |The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis,| and enjoyed both. As clever as it is, this one just didn\\u2019t work as well for me, primarily due to its structure. I found the present-day story more engaging than the alternate history. It isn\\u2019t necessarily fun to read this book, but it certainly engages the brain.  The book is over 300 pages long, contains about 75 paragraphs and only one period per paragraph. Typical of Saramago, and in my opinion, very entertaining. He begins with the story of a rather mediocre proofreader who gets annoyed with the over-confident author of a trade history book (hey, I had one of those on my dissertation committee! Just awful). So the proofreader deletes a \\\"not\\\" from a key passage. The dustjacket claims that this changes the course of history, but Saramago is not a Star Trek type sci-fi writer. Instead the book is full of the everyday angst of its undistinguished hero--\\\"Which way should I walk to work today?\\\" and \\\"Should I or shouldn't I dye my hair?\\\" for four or five pages, that kind of thing. It is a lot of fun to read, unless you happen to be going through a serious bout of angst in your own life at the moment.|And what the proofreader does to the history of the siege of Lisbon is pretty amusing, too. \\\"The truth is that history could have been written in many different ways.\\\"\",\n          \"Amazon's very Orwellian involvement with this book at the end. If Amazon ever partnered Facebook they'd own us.|This is not really a review, but one of those moments where everything that was clear to you suddenly becomes utterly muddied and you really can't say what lies beneath the murky waters although a moment before you were sure you could.|I'm reading Christopher Hitchen's astonishingly percipient and brilliant |Arguably: Essays|. I read Animal Farm too young to identify the individual animals with actual characters on the stage of communism (the old boar Major is Marx, Farmer Jones is the Tsar, the pigs Napoleon and Snowball, Stalin and Trotsky respectively) so this essay is giving me a lot to think about. So far, nothing more so than this quote (below). |(Background to the quote): A group of Ukrainian and Polish refugees in a displaced persons' camp had discovered sympathetic parallels with their own plight in Orwell's parable and had begged him for permission to translate his almost-totally unknown book. But...|The emotions of the American military authorities in Europe were not so easily touched. They rounded up all the copies of Animal Farm they could find and turned them over to the Red Army to be burned. The alliance between the farmers and the pigs so hauntingly described in the final pages of the novel were still in force.| |The book is banned in Cuba, North Korea, Burma, Iran, Kenya and most Arab countries. It is banned in the UAE not because of it's content but because it has anthropomorphic talking pigs which are unIslamic (is this not Orwellian in itself?). It is still censored in Vietnam. These nations wouldn't want ordinary people reading the book and looking at their own ruling porcine elites and seeing any parallels now would they? Who knows what kind of thoughts and actions that might lead to?|Amazon and Animal Farm|On 17 July 2009, Amazon.com withdrew certain Amazon Kindle titles, including Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell, from sale, refunded buyers, and remotely deleted items from purchasers' devices after discovering that the publisher lacked rights to publish the titles in question. Notes and annotations for the books made by users on their devices were also deleted. After the move prompted outcry and comparisons to Nineteen Eighty-Four itself, Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener stated that the company is \\\"changing our systems so that in the future we will not remove books from customers' devices in these circumstances.\\\" However, Amazon does not seem to a guarantee in its ToS that they won't don't this again and I understand that authors have the ability to edit (read 'change') parts of their books. This is because you can't buy a Kindle book, only rent one and Amazon can update (read 'change') them. |Wikipedia and other sources|Next step: |Fahrenheit 451|.

Besides, what do you know, you're just a stupid sheep...|Plus, it's just a cookie, where's the harm?|Not to mention, the last guy who complained about giving up his cookie ended up mauled by that dog. Probably just a coincidence, though.|Right?|But it's ok because pigs are smart. That's what everyone says, right? Smarter than |you| are, at any rate. And if the pig says it's ok, then it's ok.|I mean look at it! It couldn't possibly have anything but your best interests at heart!|Alright, I'm outta pig gifs.|So, I thought this was a pretty cool book. Sure, it's supposed to be about Russia, but it could just as easily be about the working class in |my| country. |Bottom line?|We need to stop listening to the spin doctors on the boob tube and start thinking for ourselves.

Animal Farm is the story of a set of animals who overthrow their human-owner. Will the animals have better lives now that the humans are gone?|Philip Pullman once said that, \\\"A story will help us make sense of anything.\\\" In this case, George Orwell uses Animal Farm as an allegory of Russian history with certain characters representing famous Russian historical figures such as Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, and Leon Trotsky. |This book was part of the monthly Readalongs that I am hosting, and what a wonderous book to begin 2022! The Readalong was simply spectacular and gave this reading such a particular depth. As the Readalong encompassed readers across the globe, we had the opportunity to discuss how the book related to our own government's history. Animal Farm provides a lot of ideas to noodle on, and I really enjoyed it. |This is one of the books on the 100 Books to Read According to the BBC List:|https://www.listchallenges.com/bbcs-t...|2023 Reading Schedule|Jan Alice in Wonderland|Feb Notes from a Small Island|Mar Cloud Atlas|Apr On the Road|May The Color Purple|Jun Bleak House|Jul Bridget Jones\\u2019s Diary|Aug Anna Karenina|Sep The Secret History|Oct Brave New World|Nov A Confederacy of Dunces|Dec The Count of Monte Cristo|Connect With Me!|Blog| |Twitter| |BookTube| |Facebook| |Insta ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL BUT SOME ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS !|In the start, I thought this book would be from the view point of animals; about how they are treated, how they expect to be treated and how man is cruel towards them.|But but but;|I am amazed at how Orwell criticizes the political maneuvers and totalitarian rule, using animals to explain what humans do. The author beautifully portrays the way a revolution is started to stop what is happening and going full circle comes to the same point it started from. Just the face of power is changed. |This book tells how the ruling class makes fool of the working class, uses their energies and resources for their own pleasure. What happens behind the closed doors of power. |How the working class is being brain washed that they are happy and satisfied and free despite of the obvious slavery they have been undergoing. |My favorite character was Benjamin (yes, a donkey) , who remains a neutral throughout and says nothing despite understanding everything.|A huge applause to Orwell for being able to explain human psyche, political and social dilemma wrapped in the form of this story. A perfect book. People will still be reading this in a thousand years time, when communism is just a footnote. \\u201cAll animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\\u201d|Those damn PIGS.|I can't even. Funnily enough, i read this book as a child and thought that it really WAS about animals. I remember thinking, Evil Pigs, I'm glad you're bacon in MY world, and Poor Hardworking Horsies, come live on my farm instead. You can have all the hay and makopa you want (sadly, no apples, tropical climate).|I reread it after education spoiled my natural inclinations for fast and absolute punishment of evildoers and eternal rewards for the good. I do find it pleasantly strange that these animals are symbols for political stereotypes and yet people still appear in the book. Isn't that CRAZY? That's literary perversion in a class all its own.|I'm thankful i read this in my formative years, before I had all this intellectual baggage (emphasis on baggage, piano on the intellect), because I got to appreciate it like a child would, almost like the way I appreciated Charlotte's Web. To me, back then, it was just another story about animals, albeit a wordy one, with no pictures.|Which is probably why I still experience a certain righteous thrill when eating crispy bacon.  Update after my February 2020 Re-read|A lot has happened in the world since I read this in high school in the mid-1990s. The book is as interesting and powerful as I remember. However, I think having an adult perspective on life, government, laws, taxes, rights, etc. makes this a much more powerful for me now than it was when I was a teenager. |One of the great things about this book, too, is that it is not very long. I think that morality tales with political undertones can be daunting if you know you are dealing with a 300-page book. This tells a strong tale in 125 pages or so that is easy to read but difficult to swallow. An allegory that is a must read for all!|I will also say that this book has an ending that I remember as being \\u201cwow, but not super shocking\\u201d as a teenager. Now, it is absolutely terrifying \\u2013 it gave me chills!|Original review|One of the best - no doubt! So much symbolism and meaning crammed into such a small book. Also, a great use of anthropomorphism (I just wanted to use a big, fancy sounding word!)|Review wise, that is about all I need to say - it is great, read it!|But, I will add this anecdote . . .|I read this when I was in High School as required reading. Most required reading books were long and not all that exciting (I am looking at you, Jane Eyre!) But, this one was so good that I couldn't put it down. And, since it is so short, I read it in one night. Well, the teacher had assigned chapters and asked us not to read ahead. Still hard to believe I got in trouble for reading too much of a required reading book! George Orwell's |Animal Farm| is undeniably one of the best short novels ever written in the English language. It is a deceptively simple tale, which even older children could read. About an animal uprising, it is written in the style of a fable, and yet it can be read on so many levels. It is clearly both a satire and an allegory, a dystopian tale, and its author George Orwell made no secret of what regime, and which politicians, he was so mercilessly parodying. Yet as with all great novels, it speaks to us today and holds many timeless truths. It is the sort of novel where a reader will find new depths in each rereading.|The inspiration for the novel came from a real-life episode. Orwell had just left the BBC, in 1943, and was uneasy about some propaganda he could see distributed by the then \\\"Ministry of Information\\\". He says,|\\\"I saw a little boy, perhaps ten years old, driving a huge carthorse along a narrow path, whipping it whenever it tried to turn. It struck me that if only such animals became aware of their strength we should have no power over them, and that men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat.\\\"|George Orwell wrote |Animal Farm| between November 1943 and February 1944, but the novel was not published straightaway, because of the USSR's status as an ally in the Second World War. George Orwell was a socialist writer, so the fact that he chose to do such a savage critique of the Soviet Union may come as a bit of a surprise to a present-day reader. One might have expected him to choose the far right, rather than the far left. But he personally felt that the Soviet Union (now Russia) of that time had itself become a brutal dictatorship, and that its original ideals had become perverted. |Animal Farm| was subsequently published in England in 1945, just after the war, and ironically it quickly became a great commercial success when it did finally appear, partly because the Cold War so quickly followed the Second World War. However the book was immediately banned in the USSR and other communist countries. To this day it is still banned or censored in some places; the United Arab Emirates, Cuba, North Korea - and China, until almost the beginning of the 21st century.|In his story George Orwell chronicles the rising to power of Joseph Stalin, who is depicted by the pig |\\\"Napoleon\\\"| in the novel. The story parallels his emergence as a natural leader, and gradually follows his rise to power as a dictator. Near the beginning of the novel, the farm animals overthrow their oppressor, the farmer |\\\"Mr Jones\\\"|. This is a direct analogy to the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917, when the Russian Tsar Nicholas II, who had abdicated in February, was executed by the Bolsheviks along with the rest of his family, in July 1918. Interestingly, Orwell said the drunken farmer Jones, who neglects his animals, was based on the real life Tsar Nicholas II. |But their democratic coalition of animals, all with a vision of independence, comfort and freedom from constraints, is gradually broken down. There is straightaway a consolidation of power among the pigs, who do no work because they are the |\\\"brainworkers\\\"| with what is tacitly agreed as superior intelligence. Just as the Soviet intelligentsia did, the pigs establish themselves as the ruling class in the new \\\"free\\\" society. In |Animal Farm| they then immediately begin to manipulate and control the new state for their own benefit.|At the start of the novel, |\\\"Major\\\"| a middle white boar, has a dream, which he relates to all the animals, in a lengthy impassioned speech. It is a dream of the future, and of freedom for all creatures. It captures their imaginations, and inspires their actions from then on. Major is based on a combination of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin. Just as Lenin's embalmed body was put on display for the people,| Major's skull is initially mounted as an emblem for the animals to revere, although by the end this is removed, and the animals are expected to worship Napoleon.| Major's principles provide the foundation for the code of the revolution and the philosophy of |\\\"Animalism\\\"|.|The other main character at the start of the novel is the pig, |\\\"Snowball\\\"| who is based on Leon Trotsky. Just as in the Soviet Union, these two characters vie for power, with |\\\"Napoleon\\\"| using subterfuge and manipulation to his own ends. He arranges false confessions, show trials and executions to enforce his power, frequently changing history as the story unfolds. |\\\"Squealer\\\"| is a pig who works on behalf of Napoleon, employing various devious means to misrepresent and confuse the animals. He is apparently based on Molotov. Squealer speechifies, using elaborate philosophical ideas which the animals cannot really follow, often using the Socratic dialogue to get the answer he desires. And this is always used to justify the pigs' greedy and unprincipled behaviour; anything which is self-serving and goes against the original ideas of fairness. George Orwell is keen to show the corruption of |\\\"Animalist\\\"| ideals by those in power, not that the ideals themselves were wrongly held. In 1947, George Orwell wrote,|\\\"For the past ten years I have been convinced that the destruction of the Soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement ... I thought of exposing the Soviet myth in a story that could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages.\\\"|For instance, Squealer works on the animals so that they accept a slogan which is almost the direct opposite of its original, |\\\"Four legs good, two legs bad\\\"| becomes |\\\"Four legs good, two legs better\\\"| overnight, as bleated by the impressionable, keen to follow, sheep. The reason for this is clear from the story. And |\\\"Snowball\\\"| (based on Trotsky) is |thus expelled from the revolutionary state| by a malicious comrade eager to dominate, using any violent means available to achieve his ends. Nobody knows who they can trust any more.|The irony is at its highest in the depiction of corruption; the tyranny and hypocrisy of the pigs as led by Napoleon. The food rations get increasingly smaller, yet it is \\\"proved\\\" to them that they are all much better off than they were formerly under Farmer Jones. The animals' ideology of liberation and equality gradually disintegrates. The rules change secretly, slowly and silently, so nobody is sure what is really the truth any longer. History is rewritten; memories become unreliable; the brainwashing is slow and subtle. The animals can read, but there is little documentation, except for seven commandments, painted on the barn wall,|1. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.|2. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.|3. No animal shall wear clothes.|4. No animal shall sleep in a bed.|5. No animal shall drink alcohol.|6. No animal shall kill any other animal.|7. All animals are equal.|Yet over time, each of these is amended, to the advantage of the pigs, until in the end there are no words showing at all, and the final famously nonsensical maxim is spouted without question, |\\\"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\\\"|The rousing song |\\\"Beasts of England\\\"|, which all the animal took as their National Anthem at the beginning of the story, is banned. The symbol depicting the horn and hoof, on their green flag, which indicated their Animalism philosophy and power, is obliterated. (This was similar in real life to the hammer and sickle on the Soviet flag.) |The novel is a dual critique against the Stalinist regime of violence, but also against the imposed rhetoric, against the language employed, logic and ideals.|Another character indicated by George Orwell is his depiction of Adolf Hitler, as one of the farmers, |\\\"Mr Frederick\\\"|, who wants to take over the renamed |\\\"Animal Farm\\\"|. But there are many minor characters whom we all recognise in our own lives. Take the cat, who votes for both sides at the same time. Who has never come across a \\\"two-faced\\\" person? Or the pony |\\\"Mollie\\\"|, the stereotypically vain and lazy original Essex girl, with her penchant for wearing ribbons in her hair and looking at herself in a mirror, regardless of any greater good which may come about by a little hard work. The story of the carthorse |\\\"Boxer\\\"| will break your heart. His courage, his steadfastness; with his personal motto, |\\\"I will work harder!\\\"| he is the archetypal salt of the earth. But he is na\\u00efve and gullible, and the reader fears that he will be taken advantage of to a devastating conclusion. You will cry, internally at least, but you will also laugh with this book. Here is an extract from the pompous poet pig, Minimus's, eulogy about Napoleon.|\\\"Friend of the fatherless!|Fountain of happiness!|Lord of the swill-bucket!\\\"|The conclusion of the book is predictable, but perhaps not in quite the simple way the reader expects. Yes, the oppressees become the oppressors, but in a fiendishly clever denouement. |All the political manipulations of the novel are recognisable today. Wherever you live, you will not have to look very close from home to find such a regime. And also, the brilliance of this novel is that those characteristics of scheming, dishonesty, cynicism, and underhanded ways of achieving a particular end, are not confined to politics. Who has never watched a skilled manipulator diverting attention from one major problem by concentrating on a minor one? It may have been in politics - or it may have been in a committee meeting - or even, dare it be said, around your own dinner table. Large or small scale, these observations by George Orwell are, sadly, truths about the human condition and human behaviour. They are timeless, and present in any institution, cooperation, business, family - in fact any group of people. One critic has even suggested that Orwell has put himself in the novels as Benjamin, the donkey, a wise old creature who is the only one who pessimistically repeats, |\\\"Life will go on as it has always gone on - that is, badly.\\\"|Have you actually read |Animal Farm|? No? Then please do. You read it years ago? Then try reading it again. It is an outstanding novel, with the hallmarks of a true classic; it is both entertaining and profound. Animal Farm| by |George Orwell|The animals of a farm, tired of the continuous abuses of human beings, decide to rebel. And after chasing the owner, they try to create a new order based on an ideological concept of equality. It looks like a fairy tale, but it's not to entertain the little ones. Mainly, Orwell explored a historical fact through this story. | |The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.|  \\u201cAnimal Farm\\u201d| is a hilarious polemic, anthropomorphic, allegorical novel on the 1917 Russian revolution, but is very much perpetually applicable to the past, current and future political state-of-affairs! It is emblematic of rebellion against dictators and totalitarianism!|It is a story of the Farmer Jones\\u2019 animals rising up in rebellion, tired of exploitation, to take over the \\u201cManor Farm\\u201d, to build a fairer society for themselves. There are stark similarities between politicians and animal leaders. |Power and use of language for controlling minds, has been astutely demonstrated in this novel, by George Orwell. Being a short-fabled fairy-like animal entertainer, it doesn\\u2019t render itself into a boring political study for a tad! |A satirical comedy on the inextricability of power and corruption, and their insidious effect on the common public! The corruption of the pigs metaphorically demonstrates the yielding of the politicians (in any age or era) for gaining power and control. The skilful use of peer pressure by pigs to keep the rest of the animals subservient, is analogous to modern-day plight of students and corporate employees!|The story begins with the 12-yr old Major(boar), revealing his dream to his comrades(other animals at farm), about the future rebellion of animals against men, and teaching all a song-\\u201cBeasts Of England\\u201d. |He clarifies to all \\u2013 |\\\"All men are enemies.

It\\u2019s an allegorical tale representing the Russian Revolution where the characters in the book represent people during this time.|I won\\u2019t go into the plot too much, but in a nutshell, this story is about a group of farm animals who rise up against the evil farmer who cares for them. They basically take over the farm by cause of Old Major (Marx/Lenen), the pig all about change. He get\\u2019s all the animals together into an uprising against Mr. Jones, the farmer (Tsar Nicholas II). The animal characters then run the farm themselves and develop their own hierarchy being lead by Snowball (Trotsky) and Napoleon (Stalin). In a way, the story reminds me of an Aesop\\u2019s Fable because the animal characters in the book have human characteristics and there are morals and messages that are quite obvious. Young readers can read it and they won\\u2019t pick up on the meaning\\u2013they\\u2019ll just think it\\u2019s a story about a group of rebellious farm animals against humans, but I believe the message that Orwell wanted to express is that power corrupts. Also that people need to think for themselves, educate yourself and make your own decisions. Don\\u2019t let others think for you.|Someone recently asked me who my favorite character was in the book which is a really difficult question to ask, in my opinion. I liked a handful of the characters including Boxer, Snowball, Benjamin, and Clover, but if I had to choose a favorite, it would have to be Snowball. Snowball\\u2019s ideas were in the best interests of the animals and he was always fair. He wanted to educate the other animals and make life easier for them. He was intelligent, brave, and stood up for his beliefs which is why he\\u2019s my favorite character in the book.|I\\u2019m not sure exactly how old my edition of |Animal Farm| is because no publication date is given, however, Goodreads seems to have this Signet Classic published in 1956. This thin paperback is in great shape for it\\u2019s age with clean, crisp pages.|My rating on this one is 5***** I first read this in Grade 11 and decided it was my favourite book. I knew a reread needed to happen right away, but it took me four years to finally get around to it when my boyfriend gifted me this beautiful illustrated edition. Animal Farm is a book I often think about and often quote, and it was a bit nerve-wracking to go back to it to see if it actually lived up to everything I had built it up to be. Thankfully, I'm thrilled to say it did.|In many ways it's a little bit underwhelming the second time around, because the plot (which lots of people will already know because it's a retelling of the Russian revolution) is extremely simplistic. This meant, however, that I was able to focus more on motivations and symbols and the other meaty stuff outside of the plot (which, don't get me wrong, was still hella exciting).|The big question: is this still my favourite book? Yes. I've not yet read a book that so succinctly and simply drives home an idea with wonderful intricacies and nuances. After all this time I also feel so comfortable with this book, I get it and love talking about it and see reflections of it all the time. Also, in response to this edition, I loved the illustrations. They were sinister and childlike and felt like political caricatures - I think Orwell would like them. Apparently Andy Serkis is going to be making a film adaptation of Animal Farm and I'm super jazzed. That doesn't really have anything to do with this review, but I wanted to share my joy.|Finally, thank you to Greg for gifting me this pretty book, reading it aloud with me over FaceTime, and letting me go on big rants about why Benjamin is the WORST. <3|June 23rd, 2012:|One of my favourite classics. Absolutely brilliant. Just great. Read it in Grade 11 and never looked back! Really introduced me into loving classics. George Orwell leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination. This is a blatant political statement. There\\u2019s no reading between the lines in order to ascertain the meaning, it\\u2019s all here on the page. After around page twenty it was very obvious how this book would end. History repeats itself and in this case it goes full circle. Nothing changes. And a wise old Donkey was the only one in the piece aware of this. We can presume he has seen it before, though, on a character level he was a bit of an ass not to tell anybody what was coming. See what I did there? I\\u2019m good. I know. |The problem I had with | Animal Farm| is that I could not engage with it. The characters aren\\u2019t really characters. The setting isn\\u2019t really a setting. And the plot isn\\u2019t really a plot. They are all mere devices, a means for Orwell to blurt out his political statement. The entire book is one big author filibuster, an entire situation and a group of characters created for the simple reason of showing Orwell\\u2019s opposition to communism and, more specifically, the Stalin regime. It\\u2019s cleverly written, and it is funny at times, but such direct authorial intention took something away from the reading experience. I couldn\\u2019t lose myself within the writing. |The pigs were used as an insult to mankind. Their leader Napoleon (aptly named?) slowly distances the pigs from the animals of the revolution. They begin to take on the traits of humans, and after a few chapters they have set themselves up as the thing they originally usurped. They become corrupt and driven by money and profit. They\\u2019re above their peers, ultimately, destroying their own aims. By doing this Orwell is calling humans pigs; he is calling post-revolutionaries pigs. For me reading this, this was more of an insult to pigs than humans. Pigs are lovely animals. (Nicer than humans?) The metaphor certainly relies much on the reader\\u2019s interpretation of what a pig is. |That\\u2019s me just being pedantic and silly, but I guess I just like pigs. And I feel like I\\u2019ve read | Animal Farm| before. I feel like I know this story, and that\\u2019s because it is the history of mankind; it is the history of revolution. So, needless to say, Orwell has captured a large sense of this on the page. When it has been read, it is definitely something that cannot be unread. The allegory is pertinent and, in a sense, an almost pessimistic truism, though the inner romantic in me finds such a defeatist attitude, well, defeating. |It\\u2019s undoubtedly very intelligent writing, but I just didn\\u2019t enjoy it. When I read literature, whether it be poetry, play or novel, I like imagining things; I like coming up with my own interpretation, meaning, or criticisms. With this, Orwell has said it all. I feel like I didn\\u2019t need to read it, a plot summary would have given me everything the writing did.|- This is the first book I read on my |2017 reading challenge|, I hope I enjoy the others more! Communism, theocracy, fascism, capitalism, neocolonialism, neoliberalism, always the same piggy style |Although it was mainly aimed at Russia and the Sowjet Union|Because they at least tried to establish a socialist communist workers' utopia just like China and other states in South East Asia and around the world. The fact that it always failed is something so multidimensional that it would blow the complexity of this review throughout the book cover. And I\\u00b4m not qualified too. So let\\u00b4s better say that each system has its flaws, and that coincidence, big history, and geopolitics influence the rise and fall of theism and totalitarianism.|All animals are the same but some are more equal|Especially apes love this idea to look at fur, gender, religion, political or economic ideology, skin color, tradition, clothes, etc. to find something that differentiates them from others as a legitimation and reason to exterminate them. Or at least first exclude, stigmatize, discriminate, enslave, and then commit genocides on them. Ironically some dictatorships like communism at least didn\\u00b4t try to kill all black, Jewish, Muslim, Catholic, etc. people, but just everyone who disobeyed, although I\\u00b4m not sure if this really is an advantage in contrast to fascism. Communism could simply kill so many more people in Russia, China, etc. because they had much more time to do so. So judging by the numbers, one could say|That the kill count counts |But how should one know which numbers are correct, because often nobody counted or was killed for trying to do so|Colonialism under authoritarian dictatorships aka monarchy fused with theocracy torture terror killed an unknown number of people|Fascism killed at least something between 75 and 100 million people|Communism killed something between 125 and 250 million people|Capitalism, neoliberalism, and neocolonialism killed an unknown number of people in all exploited areas with billions of citizens by not helping them to develop and stabilize. And guess what, I would bet that each avoidable death within the last decades, now, and in the future could reach the levels above. Another Western derision after centuries of colonialism, now rebranded as neocolonialism under the neoliberal economic Nobel Price agenda. Nobody can say how many people are dying after unimaginable suffering each minute and, most disturbing, no media or politician cares or talks about it.

This book didn't read like a 'classic' at all for me. It was so easy to get into. The writing style is simple and amazing. It's short but the story is relevant and weaved in such a way the readers get lots to think and reflect about the working system in a society, especially the political system. |This small book made me think about the class division and the different caste systems that are still relevant today. The political system is seemingly complicated but this book gave me a glimpse of it in a way how it's being played.|The part which intrigued me the most was the way the common people being manipulated or played with false promises and a better future for them. And that the lives of the ones who rebel or do something different for their betterment ends up not appreciated. |This small book gives a very clear picture how the actual society works; a vivid description on how the heirarchical system works and will continue as long as the general public blindly keeps on believing that others are going to make their lives better by helping them reach and sit on thrones who will detect them on how to work harder so that such people can party better. |The part which hit me the most was when one character who worked their whole lives for everyone else ended up as being forgotten and left to their own devices when weak and old with nothing much left for them in the end. |This book represents well the society we are living in, gives us an idea how the political system works in real and how the rest of us play our roles in the system. |The best part of reading this book is that it makes me think about how I as a person play my role in the society, how important one vote of mine matters and plays a significant role, how I am ultimately responsible for my own efforts in making the surrounding around me improve and how ignorant I am regarding the ways of the society and the political system. It's just not enough to live. Who is going to stand up for us ultimately? It's not them but we ourselves. Let's start by thinking twice about how easily we believe in the words others promise us for our future. Is it them who we are lifting them making them stand on the tip of our heads or us who's going to actually decide for that?|***Highlight:|The animal characters accurately represent the real working system as is at present \\\"I won't read again to this writer\\\", that was my first impression to \\\"ANIMAL FARM\\\".|George Orwell was recommend to me by his two most famous books:\\\"ANIMAL FARM\\\" and \\\"1984\\\", and I had started reading \\\"ANIMAL FARM\\\" first by chance. |Then I though that Orwell, almost, hadn't have something to talk about in his other book; because he \\\"has summarized up all what is happening in the occupied revolutions\\\". |Later, I knew that \\\"1984\\\" was about Dystopian world that occurs after ANIMAL FARM's world. and Overall, the book was full of simple comprehensive metaphors, and reminded me of Bolshevik traitors comrades like Trotsky and Kautsky, LOL. |\\u0644\\u0646 \\u0623\\u0642\\u0631\\u0623 \\u0644\\u0647\\u0630\\u0627 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0643\\u0627\\u062a\\u0628 \\u062b\\u0627\\u0646\\u064a\\u0629\\\". \\u0643\\u0627\\u0646 \\u0647\\u0630\\u0627 \\u0623\\u0648\\u0644 \\u0645\\u0627 \\u062a\\u0628\\u0627\\u062f\\u0631 \\u0625\\u0644\\u0649 \\u0630\\u0647\\u0646\\u064a \\u0639\\u0646\\u062f\\u0645\\u0627 \\u0627\\u0646\\u062a\\u0647\\u064a\\u062a \\u0645\\u0646 \\u0647\\u0630\\u0627 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0643\\u062a\\u0627\\u0628\\\"|\\u062a\\u0645 \\u062a\\u0631\\u0634\\u064a\\u062d \\u062c\\u0648\\u0631\\u062c \\u0623\\u0648\\u0631\\u0648\\u064a\\u0644 \\u0644\\u064a \\u0645\\u0646 \\u062e\\u0644\\u0627\\u0644 \\u0643\\u062a\\u0627\\u0628\\u064a\\u0647 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0623\\u0634\\u0647\\u0631 \\\"\\u0645\\u0632\\u0631\\u0639\\u0629 \\u0627\\u0644\\u062d\\u064a\\u0648\\u0627\\u0646\\u0627\\u062a\\\" \\u0648\\\"1984\\\"\\u060c \\u0648\\u0628\\u062f\\u0623\\u062a \\u0628\\u0645\\u0632\\u0631\\u0639\\u0629 \\u0627\\u0644\\u062d\\u064a\\u0648\\u0627\\u0646\\u0627\\u062a \\u0644\\u0627 \\u0644\\u0634\\u064a\\u0621 \\u0633\\u0648\\u0649 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0635\\u062f\\u0641\\u0629|\\\"\\u0648\\u0627\\u0631\\u062a\\u0623\\u064a\\u062a \\u0628\\u0639\\u062f\\u0647\\u0627 \\u0623\\u0646 \\u0623\\u0648\\u0631\\u0648\\u064a\\u0644\\u060c \\u0639\\u0644\\u0649 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0623\\u063a\\u0644\\u0628\\u060c \\u0644\\u0645 \\u064a\\u0639\\u062f \\u0644\\u062f\\u064a\\u0647 \\u0645\\u0627 \\u064a\\u0642\\u0648\\u0644\\u0647 \\u0644\\u064a \\u0641\\u064a \\u0643\\u062a\\u0627\\u0628\\u0647 \\u0627\\u0644\\u062b\\u0627\\u0646\\u064a\\u060c \\u0641\\u0623\\u0631\\u0648\\u064a\\u0644 \\u0642\\u062f \\\"\\u0644\\u062e\\u0635 \\u0643\\u0644 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0644\\u064a \\u0628\\u064a\\u062d\\u0635\\u0644 \\u0641\\u064a \\u0627\\u0644\\u062b\\u0648\\u0631\\u0627\\u062a \\u0627\\u0644\\u0641\\u0627\\u0634\\u0644\\u0629|***|\\u0645\\u0627\\u0632\\u0644\\u062a\\u0645 \\u062a\\u0631\\u064a\\u062f\\u0648\\u0646 \\u0633\\u0645\\u0627\\u0639 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0645\\u0632\\u064a\\u062f \\u0639\\u0646 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0631\\u0648\\u0627\\u064a\\u0629\\u061f \\u0623\\u0631\\u0634\\u062d \\u0644\\u0643\\u0645 |\\u0645\\u0631\\u0627\\u062c\\u0639\\u0629 \\\"\\u0641\\u0647\\u062f\\\"| \\u0627\\u0644\\u062a\\u064a \\u062a\\u062d\\u0643\\u064a \\u0627\\u0644\\u0637\\u0631\\u064a\\u0642 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0630\\u064a \\u062e\\u0627\\u0636\\u0647 \\u0623\\u0648\\u0631\\u0648\\u064a\\u0644 \\u0644\\u0643\\u062a\\u0627\\u0628\\u062a\\u0647\\u0627\\u060c \\u0645\\u0639 \\u0628\\u0639\\u0636 \\u0627\\u0644\\u062a\\u062d\\u0644\\u064a\\u0644 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0644\\u0637\\u064a\\u0641\\u060c \\u0648\\u062a\\u0646\\u062a\\u0647\\u064a \\u0641\\u064a \\u0627\\u0644\\u0641\\u0642\\u0631\\u0629 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0623\\u062e\\u064a\\u0631\\u0629 \\u0628\\u0645\\u0644\\u062e\\u0635 \\u0628\\u0633\\u064a\\u0637 \\u0639\\u0646 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0642\\u0635\\u0629 \\u0641\\u064a\\u0647 \\u0634\\u064a\\u0621 \\u0645\\u0646 \\u062d\\u0631\\u0642 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0623\\u062d\\u062f\\u0627\\u062b. |\\u0648\\u0647\\u0630\\u0647 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0645\\u0631\\u0627\\u062c\\u0639\\u0629 \\u0645\\u0646\\u062a\\u0642\\u0627\\u0629 \\u0645\\u0646 \\u0628\\u062d\\u0631 \\u0645\\u0646 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0645\\u0631\\u0627\\u062c\\u0639\\u0627\\u062a \\u0627\\u0644\\u0633\\u064a\\u0626\\u0629 \\u0630\\u0627\\u062a \\u0627\\u0644\\u062a\\u0642\\u064a\\u064a\\u0645 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0639\\u0627\\u0644\\u064a.  |\\u201cAll animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\\u201d| |An allegorical parody of Stalinism, Animal Farm is considered to be one of Orwell's more popular works. Heavily inspired by Orwell's experiences during the Spanish Civil War, the novel is about a number of farm animals who revolt against their drunken and irresponsible owners and caretakers, driving them out of the farm and taking care of affairs themselves. The story is based on an ideology called |Animalism|, a tongue-in-cheek reference to Communism, where among the Seven Commandments the most important states that |\\\"All animals are equal\\\"|.|Eventually, we find this replaced by: | |\\\"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\\\"| | | | | |The Horn and Hoof Flag described in the book appears to be based on the hammer and sickle, the Communist symbol.| | |Background|During the Spanish Civil War, the Republican government was supported by a number of factions with conflicting aims, including the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM \\u2013 Partido Obrero de Unificaci\\u00f3n Marxista), the anarcho-syndicalist Confederaci\\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (a wing of the Spanish Communist Party, which was backed by Soviet arms and aid). The ILP was linked to the POUM so Orwell joined the POUM.|Unfortunately, Communist propaganda during the war led to the Republicans coming to believe that the POUM were corroborating with the fascists, leading to a purge, as POUM members were persecuted, arrested and tried for treason. The Orwells were forced into hiding and, on returning to England, found that a deposition was presented to the |Tribunal for Espionage & High Treason|, Valencia, charging them with \\\"rabid Trotskyism\\\", and being agents of the POUM.|The trial of the leaders of the POUM and of Orwell (in his absence) took place in Barcelona in October and November 1938. Observing events from French Morocco, Orwell wrote that they were |\\\"only a by-product of the Russian Trotskyist trials and from the start every kind of lie, including flagrant absurdities, has been circulated in the Communist press.\\\"|In the preface of a 1947 Ukrainian edition of |Animal Farm|, he explained how escaping the communist purges in Spain taught him |\\\"how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries\\\"|. This motivated Orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he saw as the Stalinist corruption of the original socialist ideals. Under the leadership of the pigs, the animals of Manor Farm overthrow their human owner and go into business for themselves with all animals doing their part. However, some parts involve a lot less work than others and things quickly change...|I somehow managed to dodge this landmine in high school and the ensuing couple decades. However, I had a few conversations about it at work and decided it was time to give it a read.|Animal Farm is a dystopian tale of revolution and the ensuing government. According to everyone, it's an allegory of the Russian revolution of 1917. However, it could easily be an allegory of every revolution ever. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.|The revolution happens fairly quickly. The pigs organize the other animals and send farmer Jones out on his ass. After that, the future looks bright for about fifteen minutes. Then the pigs start maneuvering against each other and fucking over the other animals. There's also scapegoating, lying, rewriting history, and all sorts of things no government today does. That was sarcasm, before anyone decides to chime in.|This is a powerful little book with many messages. Power corrupts. Communism doesn't work. Those who don't know the past are doomed to repeat it. People are dicks. |There are some classics that are as dry as a geriatric's vagina and pretty joyless to read. Other classics are fairly easy reads containing a wealth of wisdom.

Well, to be completely honest, my heart began to sink from the very first page. This was my first exposure to Wallace\\u2019s fiction, so I was paying quite close attention to the opening paragraphs to try and soak up this style that so many people have fallen in love with. Defence Exhibit A \\u2013 the opening:|I am seated in an office, surrounded by heads and bodies. My posture is consciously congruent to the shape of my hard chair [...]. My fingers are mated into a mirrored series of what manifests, to me, as the letter X.|WARWICK. I submit I was justified in feeling immediate concern that the prose is awkward, unlovely, and try-hard, with outbreaks of horrendous juvenile alliteration.|PROSECUTOR: Objection! The opening section is clearly narrated by a precocious child genius, making the tone entirely appropriate.|JUDGE: Sustained.|WARWICK: That\\u2019s true. And I was definitely willing to go along with that. The problem is that as the book goes on, you start to realise that basically all his narrators sound pretty much the same \\u2013 they\\u2019re all variants on the same depressive, overeducated outsider, speaking in these jagged, straining, uncomfortable sentences. On the few occasions when he attempts social dialects beyond his own \\u2013 including a few passages of extremely ill-advised colloquial Ebonics \\u2013 it sounds more like a grotesque parody than any serious attempt at a socially inclusive writing style. Besides, is it really an excuse for a writer to say \\u2018My characters all happen to talk like malfunctioning robots, so you\\u2019re just going to have to put up with it\\u2019?|PROSECUTOR: \\u2018Overeducated\\u2019? Really? That may apply to the Incandenza family, but it\\u2019s hardly something you could accuse the residents of Ennet House Drug and Alcohol Recovery Center of. Isn\\u2019t it, in fact, the case that Wallace\\u2019s daring new amalgam of contemporary patois and technical jargon simply went over your head?|WARWICK: Objection. Beyond the scope.|JUDGE: How is that beyond the scope?|WARWICK: I don\\u2019t know, it\\u2019s just one of those things they always say on |The Good Wife|.|JUDGE: Overruled. Answer the question.|WARWICK: All right, I |don\\u2019t| think it\\u2019s going over my head, no. The writing style is certainly innovative, but mainly in the sense that he sounds stilted and infelicitous in ways that no one has come up with before. His pile-ups of noun-phrases are particularly awkward, the nouns\\u2019 plurals\\u2019 genitives\\u2019 apostrophes so aggressively correct that they actually manage to look wrong. I hate the sloppy attempt in general to use exaggerated colloquialisms as a deliberate style \\u2013 this habit he has of rambling vaguely around a topic for several paragraphs in the hope that one of his phrases will hit home. I like writers who craft and refine their thoughts |before| typing them out, not during. Overall I just felt there was a horrible uncertainty of tone, the narrative voice channel-hopping compulsively from slangy to highly mannered to jargonistic, often within the same sentence. It doesn\\u2019t cohere, but more to the point it doesn\\u2019t feel like DFW is in any control.|PROSECUTOR: Does it not occur to you that this might be done for deliberate effect? Or were you perhaps just put off by all the long words? |(laughter from the jury)|WARWICK: Well...I\\u2019m reasonably sure it\\u2019s not that. I love complicated books with gigantic, exuberant vocabularies. It\\u2019s just that here, because of the general sense of bloated free-fall, it all just seems so purposeless, so gratuitous. To me he comes across less as an artist with a fat vocabulary than a hack with a fat thesaurus.|(Woman in gallery faints)|MAN IN GALLERY: You monster!|WARWICK: Defence Exhibit B, m\\u2019lud \\u2013 a description of a character\\u2019s smile, which is said to be \\u2018empty of all affect\\u2019:|as if someone had contracted her circumorals with a thigmotactic electrode.|PROSECUTOR: Of course, one of those smiles.

It\\u2019s like his proliferation of initialisms \\u2013 why are E.T.A. and A.F.R. and U.S.A. written with dots but MDMA and WETA and AA without them? There\\u2019s no answer except general inconsistency, which fans will no doubt tell me is intentional but which is no less annoying for that. The same goes for Wallace\\u2019s pseudo-encyclopaedic knowledge base. Hal Incandenza is supposed to be an etymology expert who grew up memorising the OED. But every time we see this put into practice, it\\u2019s hopelessly wrong. E.g.: \\u201cThere are, by the |O.E.D. VI|\\u2019s count, nineteen nonarchaic synonyms for |unresponsive|\\u201d \\u2013 which makes no sense, because OED 3 won\\u2019t be completed for another 25 years or so so there\\u2019s no chance of getting to \\u201cVI\\u201d by the near-future of the novel\\u2019s setting; and anyway the OED doesn\\u2019t even |list| synonyms because it\\u2019s a dictionary, not a thesaurus. He traces the word |anonymous| back to Greek but the Greek is horribly misspelled; he traces |acceptance| back to \\u201c14th-century langue-d\\u2019oc French\\u201d but this phrase is both oxymoronic and flat-out wrong. Where is the research here? All through the book there is a profound feeling that David Foster Wallace did not really understand the things he was looking up in order to seem clever.|PROSECUTOR: Need we remind you that this is a work of fiction and not an academic thesis?|WARWICK: Again, it\\u2019s about confidence in your author. Mine quickly evaporated. I\\u2019m concentrating on language stuff only because it\\u2019s an area where I have an admittedly very dilettantish but somewhat active interest. People who know more about these things than me tell me his maths is equally dodgy. Now contrast all this with a writer like Nabokov or Pynchon, to whom Wallace is sometimes cavalierly compared. When I read Pynchon I can spend hours chasing up throwaway references to some obscure language, some astronomical phenomenon, a paragraph of Argentine politics or an obsolete scientific theory \\u2013 it\\u2019s part of the fun of these big encyclopedic books that you can research all the related knowledge that lies just outside the margins. The references hold up and they enrich the reading experience. When I try and do the same thing with DFW, I always seem to come away with the conviction that he doesn\\u2019t really know what he\\u2019s talking about.|PROSECUTOR |(with heavy sarcasm)|: How unfortunate that so many people overlooked this and mistakenly found his writing moving and powerful.|WARWICK: Oh come on, don\\u2019t be like that. I am delighted that some people love his style, it\\u2019s just not for me. I totally admit that this is personal preference. I, personally, like writers who craft beautiful sentences. In my opinion, Wallace is just not very good at the level of the sentence, or even of the paragraph. But he can be great over longer distances \\u2013 at the level of the chapter or long passage. There are several extended sequences of |Infinite Jest| that have a kind of cumulative power and excitement to them that I admired very much indeed. They were just padded out with far too many passages of inexcusable tedium.|VOICES FROM CROWD: Boo! Hanging\\u2019s too good for him!|JUDGE |(banging gavel)|: Order!

Yes, I did.|PROSECUTOR: And is it not true that those passages included, but were not limited to, the description of Poor Tony Krause having a seizure; the fight outside Ennet House; and Don Gately\\u2019s fever-dream sequences?|HANNAH |(bursting into tears)|: It\\u2019s true! He said one of them was the...the best thing he\\u2019d read all year.

If a monkey throws a thousand darts at a dartboard, he\\u2019s going to score a couple of bullseyes. He\\u2019s also probably going to hit you in the eye a few times. And in the context of this metaphor, a monkey-inflicted dart-wound to the face can be taken as the equivalent of, say, an unforgivably tedious description of a geopolitical tennis game.|PROSECUTOR: The point remains, however, that you found yourself moved by parts of this book, didn\\u2019t you? Affected by the characters\\u2019 story?|WARWICK: Sure. Some characters worked better than others. I thought Don Gately in particular was a wonderful creation and I only wish he\\u2019d been in a tighter and better-controlled novel.|PROSECUTOR: You were moved, gripped, excited \\u2013 even aroused at times.|WARWICK: Well, I wouldn\\u2019t go |that| far.|PROSECUTOR: Oh really? Isn\\u2019t it the case that, on one occasion last week, you found your mind, in an idle moment of alone time, returning to a certain cheerleader-based episode of mass knickerlessness...?|WARWICK |(leaping out of seat)|: Ob-|jection|, your honour!!

I really don\\u2019t want to hear about it.|Sighs of relief from public gallery.|WARWICK: Although, thinking about it, the query does serve to highlight a certain strain of misogyny that bothered me about the book \\u2013 where the narrator gives Avril Incandenza extra value by repeatedly telling us that she is particularly gorgeous \\u2018for a woman her age\\u2019, while the nearest thing we have to a female lead is known as \\u2018PGOAT\\u2019 \\u2013 sorry, \\u2018P.G.O.A.T.\\u2019 \\u2013 the \\u2018Prettiest Girl Of All Time\\u2019 \\u2013 and is also defined by her physical attractiveness, or the possible marring thereof.|PROSECUTOR |(rolling his eyes at jury)|: Oh that\\u2019s right, play the sexism card now. And I suppose you were equally unmoved by the gripping descriptions of social deprivation \\u2013 an insight into a world that doubtless a middle-class bourgeois reader like you couldn\\u2019t hope to evaluate?|WARWICK: First of all, you should probably be careful what you assume about my background. Second of all, yes some of it worked really well. But again, there is a lack of authorial control. A lot of the violence and stories of drugged-out atrocities start off being genuinely disturbing, but end up going so far that they take on a Grand-Guignol aspect and become too ludicrous to take seriously. When one woman at an addiction meeting mentions her father\\u2019s late-night visits to the bedroom of her severely disabled sister, it\\u2019s very creepy and upsetting. But Wallace can\\u2019t stop himself going on to give us three full, unnecessary pages of detailed \\u201cincestuous diddling\\u201d (his phrase) which turns the whole thing from disturbing into cartoonish and silly.|PROSECUTOR: So there\\u2019s something \\u2018silly\\u2019 about sexual abuse, is there?|WARWICK: I\\u2019ll ignore that. Look, I agree that there were parts of this book that I enjoyed very much, of course there were. But I would draw your attention to the fact that during these moments of narrative brilliance, the footnotes and speech tics and other po-mo devices suddenly dry up: he doesn\\u2019t need them. This leads me to conclude that they really serve no purpose except to distract from the turgid flabbiness of other sections of the novel. Whose plot, by the way, goes absolutely nowhere \\u2013 nothing is resolved and no questions are answered.|PROSECUTOR: Again, we would argue that this is deliberate, your honour \\u2013 forcing the reader back to the text so that the book itself becomes an \\u2018infinite\\u2019 form of Entertainment like the one it describes.|WARWICK: Oh come on. This argument stretches \\u2018generosity to the author\\u2019 beyond the bounds of credibility.|PROSECUTOR: And yet somehow, reviewers who are actually |paid| to review books \\u2013 unlike you \\u2013 have described this novel as \\u2018profound\\u2019 and \\u2018a masterpiece\\u2019 and \\u2018brilliant and witty\\u2019 \\u2013 refer to prosecution exhibits A through W.|WARWICK: Let\\u2019s not forget the |London Review of Books| |review|, Defence Exhibit D \\u2013 and I quote:|[I]t is, in a word, terrible....

While I don't |actually| have A Favorite Book (or Song, or Album, or Band, or Film, or Painting, or Sexual Position, or any other category of things that contain more than one equally great contender) |Infinite Jest| is the first book that immediately comes to mind when the idea of My Favorite Book arises.|As I've already alluded to and partially instantiated in a few scattered places around GoodReads, I feel that I read this book at the right time. The contingent particulars which culminated as the temporal whole that was My Life converged with my reading of this book rather beautifully. |First of all, I had zero knowledge of the book and author before and throughout my reading. I came upon it as a babe in the woods in these regards. I was completely unaware of its popular and largely positive critical reception seven years prior in 1996. For this I am grateful. It's all too easy to hop on the backlash bandwagon when \\\"critical darlings\\\" and \\\"it-people\\\" of the moment emerge on your radar. I take great pains to try to avoid this kind of thing, but it's not easy.|I also was juggling a variety of ongoing, confused trains of thought about the basic subjects that the book focuses on\\u2014to boil them down as far as relevantly and reasonably possible: Addiction, Entertainment, and Western Culture, specifically that of the modern US of A. I was also deep in the trenches of \\\"stomach-level sadness.\\\"{1}|____________________________________________|{1} |What were you intending to do when you started this book?|I wanted to do something sad. I'd done some funny stuff and some heavy, intellectual stuff, but I'd never done anything sad. And I wanted it not to have a single main character. The other banality would be: I wanted to do something real American, about what it's like to live in America around the millennium. |And what is that like?|There's something particularly sad about it, something that doesn't have very much to do with physical circumstances, or the economy, or any of the stuff that gets talked about in the news. It's more like a stomach-level sadness. I see it in myself and my friends in different ways. It manifests itself as a kind of lostness. Whether it's unique to our generation I really don't know. (|Interview|)|____________________________________________|I had borrowed the copy that I read the first time around from my best friend at the time, who I'd been close with since early childhood. I'd been confiding some existential angst to him about depression and the exacerbation of said depression with miscellaneous self-medicating behavioral patterns. He responded by solemnly handing me a thick book wrapped in the image of white cumulus clouds imposed upon a bright blue sky. |Cut to the summer of 2004: I'd just finished my first year of real (not community) college and was working on the buildings and grounds crew around the campus in exchange for eight dollars an hour and a free room. I spent the days doing all manner of maintenance and grunt work and my nights poring over this book and dramatically rediscovered the joys of falling head first into a fictional world and the redemptive value of communing with the consciousness of another person through reading and writing. I also found another artist to feel a deep kinship with and solely through the type of communion that is mediated by pulped trees and ink. Wallace was rather quickly inducted into the ever-expanding (and occasionally contracting) roster that is my pantheon of personal heroes, and as such also rapidly ascended through the ranks to sit somewhere vaguely near the zenith point (again, the trouble with ranking).|I was hooked in a big way by the time I hit upon the scene describing the torturously self-conscious, self-doubting thoughts of a cannabis addict named Ken Erdedy. This was well before the hundredth page mark. It perfectly captured the mind of a hyper-analytic depressive and compulsive THC ingestor. From the sorrowfully resigned glee (that all minutely self-aware addicts feel at various points along the path of Addiction) of planning a two week long \\\"marijuana vacation\\\"{2} to the descriptions of how depressing having sex with someone would be in such an excessively stoned and self-loathing state.{3}|____________________________________________|{2} Consisting mainly of drawing the blinds, shutting off the phone, being perpetually intoxicated with pot smoke, watching films, vigorously masturbating, and loads of fractally expanding and contracting shame and despair lurking beneath it all and frequently bursting through the surface for greedy gulps of oxygen and one-on-one time with the vacationer\\u2019s psyche. This planning is all being done in the context of desperately attempting to find a way to finally pluck the compulsive behavior (getting high) from his life\\u2014excessive use of the demonized substance is rationalized as the savior, the one thing that will finally make him disgusted enough to quit forever. |{3} |\\\"He had never once had actual intercourse on marijuana. Frankly, the idea repelled him. Two dry mouths bumping at each other, trying to kiss, his self-conscious thoughts twisting around on themselves like a snake on a stick while he bucked and snorted dryly above her, his swollen eyes red and his face sagging so that its slack folds maybe touch, limply, the folds of her own loose sagging face as it sloshed back and forth on his pillow, its mouth working dryly.\\\"| (pp. 22-23)|____________________________________________|There's simply too much\\u2014too many amazing scenes and characters\\u2014to even begin the process of surgically removing them, holding them up to the light of the review, and rendering them vague enough to maintain some requisite mystery and yet contextualized enough to give each pinned down specimen some mouth-watering OOMPF! for the Dear Reader. It simply cannot be done. (People can cast their gaze in the direction of the myriad collegiate dissertations already written about this book and/or a book called | |Elegant Complexity| | if they want in-depth analysis.) Luckily, many of the people I know who will read this review have already read the novel.|So there's a terrible type of rumor that roams around about this book, and Wallace more generally, and these sentiments can be rounded up and boiled down to \\\"It's all PoMo trickery and no heart.\\\" |Wrong.| So very, very wrong. I\\u2019ve always seen this book as the emergent property/locus of a web-like arrangement of profoundly emotionally compelling portraits of people, places and things. This is its core, its essence, its fundamental organizing principle. Yes, there are some gags, like footnotes and some funny names, but what the naysayers seem to overlook are the hundreds of seismically moving descriptions of human struggles and triumphs; from the head-clutchingly/jaw-gapingly dramatic to the very recognizably monotonous (which can be very edifying, this process of recognition); from the painfully, |inherently| private and singular to the monumentally universal and public. |Wallace's desire to write a sorrowful book is fully realized here. I think it\\u2019s safe to say that this a tragedy\\u2014in the Shakespearean{4} sense of the term\\u2014and that it, like the greatest tragedies, does not simply pummel you with darkness but pokes holes of humor and joy through the opaque veil to allow for some breathing room. Indeed, there are some extremely funny things going on in this book and it\\u2019s mostly a darker shade of humor that is employing them. Not at all like putting a clown nose on a prisoner being executed or anything\\u2014DFW is much more naturally funny than that\\u2014but a beautiful balance of the genuinely sad, the genuinely funny and the instances of absurdity where both overlap.|____________________________________________|{4} FYI: The title comes from a line in |Hamlet|, \\\"Alas, poor Yorick!\\u2014I knew him, Horatio; a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.\\\"|____________________________________________|I also think of this book as mostly embodying a style of realism, though there are occasionally some rather extraordinary things taking place as well. What I'm trying to stress is that it\\u2019s not some non-stop ride of wacky gimmicks and metafiction (which is strangely\\u2014|and mistakenly|\\u2014the impression some blurbs give of this book). Beneath the hilarious absurdity of things like business corporations annually purchasing the names of the year (which is a brilliant gag, by the way) there is a massive foundation of stark realism and humanism perched stoically beneath, and it's all just slightly, artfully tweaked in ways that makes you wonder how |this| or |that| instance of absurdity is really much different from the absurdity faced in your slice of the non-fictional world that you inhabit. I\\u2019ll go ahead and just state it plainly: referring to our units of measurement, like our neat bundles of 365 days, as things like \\\"Year of the Adult Depends Undergarment\\\" or \\\"Year of the Trial-Sized Dove Bar\\\" is |less| insane than the very real concept of |corporate personhood|.|As far as self-referentiality and the use of metafictional techniques are concerned, I simply see none of it. Nowhere are we \\\"cleverly\\\" \\\"reminded\\\" that we're reading a book\\u2014at least not explicitly. Nowhere is that little wink and nudge of \\\"This is a book/I am an author writing a book\\\" ever inserted into the prose. This was something Wallace very consciously avoided along with a species of irony that he\\u2019s referred to as being representative of | |\\\"the song of a bird who\\u2019s come to love its cage.\\\"| | |I've discussed this with Bram before and he makes some mention of DFW\\u2019s self-consciousness seeping through the pages of |Infinite Jest| in |his wonderful, if slightly less religiously devoted review|. Bram\\u2019s point seems to be more so that Wallace\\u2019s voice throughout the novel is very much |his voice| (the same type of charge |gets launched at DeLillo, as I briefly covered elsewhere|). This is indisputable. The thing is this: it doesn\\u2019t bother me in the least because, as Bram writes on the subject of DFW\\u2019s voice, |\\\"Whatever his reason for writing this way, it works because this voice is such a joy to read.\\\"| Amen, brother Bram. |Indeed, I found it to be |such| a joy that I didn\\u2019t even notice this fact about the prose-style in either my first or second reading. I don\\u2019t mind that the thoughts of a physically deformed and mentally challenged teenager are narrated with the same voice as the thoughts of a clinically depressed thirtysomething woman, or a wheelchair-bound Qu\\u00e9b\\u00e9coise assassin, or the prettiest (veiled) girl of all time, or an alcoholic experimental filmmaker |and| his childhood self, et cetera. |The book is written from a completely |third-person| perspective, too. This is an important fact to note. Had Wallace tried to cram his voice into |first-person| perspectives of the characters it would\\u2019ve been an unpublishable disaster. But he didn\\u2019t, it wasn't, so let's get over it and just come to grips with what it means to write from the third-person perspective. In sum, this book is proof positive, by my lights, that characters don\\u2019t have to take on wildly different tones of voice and manners of thought and speech in order to be rendered deeply sympathetic and compelling. |For most of the book the prose is so pitch-perfect and the on-page action so arresting that I simply didn\\u2019t make a note of this just-now-mentioned technical stuff about perspective, tonal-shifts, and so on. There are some relative lulls, like some of the extended descriptions of tennis matches, but on the vastly larger slice of the pie chart the book remains extremely entertaining, thought-provoking, tear-duct-lubing, belly-tickling, soul-massaging, etc. The scenes at Ennett Recovery House and the AA meetings are flawless and much of it struck me quite strongly as being amazingly insightful and emotionally jarring. Upon my second reading of the novel I discovered where the cover image of the sky might |possibly| have come from:|\\\"You are at a fork in the road that Boston AA calls your |Bottom|, though the term is misleading, because everybody here agrees it\\u2019s more like someplace very high and unsupported: you\\u2019re on the edge of something tall and leaning way out forward....\\\"| (p. 347)|Everything involving the Incandenza family is superb. Same with Joelle Van Dyne (aka Madame Psychosis, aka P.G.O.A.T {Prettiest Girl of All Time}). Same with Gately. Same with the entire conceptual-metaphorical apparatus behind the notorious film mostly known as \\\"The Entertainment\\\" (officially titled |Infinite Jest|) as well as the actual socio-political entanglements that surround it. Same with the brilliant conversational back 'n' forths between Marathe and Steeply, where some of the greatest insights into the three major themes of the novel occur. Same with Wallace's sheer talent with language, including the coining of highly memorable terms and idioms. There are now two phrases I use around fellow fans of this book when the moment is appropriate: \\\"the howling fantods\\\" (in reference to feelings of extreme nervousness and high-strung emotional strain) and \\\"to eliminate one's map\\\" (in reference to suicide). I could gush on and on and on and on...|This all just makes me want to settle into Round Three right this very second and read it all over again\\u2014and I just might. |Infinite Jest| has the quality of slowly unfurling in your memory, which makes sense considering the sheer length, the descriptive depth, and the broad spectrum of content. Each re-exposed detail symbiotically attaches itself into the larger, self-organizing, cumulative memory of how fucking amazing the book was and indeed still is. |When I met the tome's final sentence and finished it off I was left with an amazing set of feelings that's very difficult to describe satisfactorily. Basically, I felt a deep abiding sadness at the fact that it was now finished. I found myself somewhat frantically flipping between the final page and the \\\"Notes & Errata\\\" section, irrationally seeking more words\\u2014I may as well have been tearing the room apart looking for meth money. I felt a physiological craving confined and radiating within. I wanted |more|! More entertainment! More communion. More redemption. More identification. And then as I sat stunned and staring at the final paragraph it hit me: David Foster Wallace wanted the reader to feel this way.{5}|____________________________________________|{5} On some level all writers and artists and anyone trying to \\\"sell\\\" anything (ideas, feelings, books, etc) to other people all want those people to keep coming back for more, but there was more than that standard set of intentions going on in |Infinite Jest|. He was trying to show people something about themselves, namely that sad, funny, and strange spectacle of continually seeking pleasure and relief.|____________________________________________|He wanted the reader to acknowledge Craving. He turned the mirror of the Ennett House upon the reader and captured their reflection and left them with things to think deeply about outside of the book. My eyes widened and my jaw literally dropped open and the word \\\"Genius\\\" popped into my head, scattering the cognitive noise and bringing me one more brief moment of Thoughtless Bliss. Admittedly, Infinite Jest is a tough book. You start the book having no clue when it is happening and who the various characters are. There is stuff that happens in the opening pages that explains events at the end of the book, albeit over 1000 pages and hundreds of footnotes away. I'd say it is quite elliptical. That being said, it is an amazing piece of literature. I forced myself through the first 300 and then 400 pages and at about 500 pages I finally hit my stride and was able to follow through to 1071 (yes this was the British printing not the American one). I loved the characters and the high comedy that is here as well as all the wacky situations in the drug rehab centre and the tennis academy. The president reminded me a lot of the current American regime (I could almost see the Statue of Liberty carrying a Trump Tower logo across her forehead or maybe a Chick-Fil-A sign) and the text was occasionally of incredible beauty and insight.|Take this passage from the Marathe/Steeply dialog:|\\u201cSomeone who had authority, or should have had authority and did not exercise authority.

And oh, so relevant!|I talked for a few hours to fellow Goodreads reading addict Nocturnalux and tried to get her convinced that this should be on her reading list.

Really. Just read every single (fuh-cking!) word from beginning til the end, you get an award. & that's what THIS IS, basically. A badge of honor. Bragging rights. A Privilege.

That we live in a systematic place where components are controlled (by family, substances, life). The back and forth between the school and the rehab embody a game of tennis (emblematic \\\"system\\\" used to symbolize coming-of-age as well as the myriad needlepoint philosophies that go with it). No patterns arise! Yet the reader has (always) his wants. That you don't matter in the enterprise is what ultimately spoils this experience for me. The writer has very consciously tried to build a sturdy monolithic castle from individual grains of dry sand. An impossible endeavor, but it must be witnessed. The things that stick out are the sordid details: the head in the microwave, the shot in the face; the molestation of little boys, of invalids; a hanging fetus.|If you say I.J. is the future of the novel, you definitely haven't read 1936's \\\"Gone with the Wind.\\\" Almost a full century old, that tome really justifies its girth (like \\\"Lonesome Dove\\\" & \\\"The Stand\\\" do, like \\\"Don Quixote\\\" & \\\"Les Miserables\\\" eons ago). I understand the allure of this, really, I do, but HOW MANY DIFFERENT WAYS CAN YOU SAY THE EXACT SAME THING? Definitely not in 1088 pages! But maybe eighty-eight.|Bottom line: this novel really gave me a serious case of the \\\"howling fantods.\\\" I've been waiting, panther-like, for the right combination of caffeine and personal gumption to strike, to attack writing about this, since it really is one of my favorite books ever-ever, and one of the most fascinating things I've ever read. I've read this book twice and I could care less what people say about it, because when I *do* care, I tend to grit my teeth over the ridiculous comments & reviews that tend to come up in discussing David Foster Wallace's work. People like to levy the criticism that the book is \\\"sloppy\\\" or \\\"digressive\\\". Really? You think? An 1100 page book with 200 pages of small-print footnotes might be a little digressive or indulgent or maddening? It might stray a wee bit into uncharted, dark-woods territory? Jeez.|There is, in art, what I like to call the \\\"crazy project\\\". Once you go to work on the Crazy Project -- C.P. for short -- you don't leave the Crazy Project. You don't FINISH the crazy project. You can -- when you are really involved in it, I mean really involved -- scarcely even talk about it; you may not even realize you're involved in it. The C.P. involves being given a hammer (the only real tool of the artist), a mouthful of nails, and being sent \\\"over yonder hill\\\" and told to do AS MUCH DAMAGE AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN with the hammer you have been given. When working on the C.P., the creative force is one in the same as the destructive force, and your hammer is a useful tool regardless of which way you are swinging it.|I think DFW is one of the most fascinating authors alive -- he's doing work with the English language in the tradition of Kathy Acker, Bill Burroughs, or James Joyce. The marketplace demands \\\"novels\\\" and so people oblige, but there is a difference between a \\\"novel\\\" and a BOOK, and I would consider a book to be more interesting -- if more difficult and less \\\"composed\\\"-- and Infinite Jest is definitely a BOOK, and shouldn't be treated as a \\\"novel\\\" in the same way, say, \\\"Life of Pi\\\" is a novel (and I do think Life of Pi is terrific, don't get me wrong). But, if you want immaculately written works of fiction by Wallace, check out his short stories -- especially the ones in Girl w/ Curious Hair -- because these conform more to what you would expect from traditional notions of \\\"reading fiction\\\". If you want a beautiful, wildly ambitious, insanely indulgent, uncompromising mind-bending skull-violating MESS, one that comprises an entire Victorian manor of the Crazy Project, then Infinite Jest may well be worth your while.|The book is, definitely, a mess, let's not mince words. It is also obsessively-compulsively mathematical in the way that DFW seems to enjoy; there is an order to the chaos, and it did take reading it a second time to pull out some of the exquisitely crafted crystalline plot strands he was working at. Linearity & coherence of disparate plot elements is not what the book is interested in, be warned. |But before I make the case of this being some academic project with no soul, let me say that reading this, I was genuinely surprised and moved by how deep & real the characters in it become. The characters in here are terribly tragic, in a real Shakespearian sense (the book's title is after all a reference to Hamlet), and their tapestry in this book's pages is as intimate and heartrending as it is vast; this book is a language project but one that remains absolutely invested in the lives of the people involved in that \\\"project\\\".|The book is about a lot of things: American culture & the nature of desire, fathers and sons, art, addiction, institutions, drugs, consciousness, film & the nature of narrative . . . too much to go into. More than anything, I think, the book is about addiction, and how our desires are moderated and mediated by culture, and how desire & addiction are entwined, and how Westerners approach these things.|Infinite Jest is wildly funny and, like I mentioned above, almost unexpectedly moving: there is a kind of veneer between the reader and the characters; they are guarded and stoic people, for the most part, and \\\"getting to know\\\" them can be as frustrating as trying to \\\"get to know\\\" someone in your own life who is guarded and careful with their emotions. But over the course of hundreds of pages you learn the inner-workings of IJ's huge cast, and their emotional motivations and subtleties begin to resonate with you in ways that dig so deep I think they're almost frightening.|This book is dense enough -- to say the least -- that I think you can get out of it whatever you are willing to put into it. Isn't this true of most good art? But the depth here is incredible. To say I'm \\\"biased\\\" and a bit blinded to criticisms about this book is hardly the point -- I think its a marvel, I think its a mess, I think it taught me what the difference is between a book & a novel, and why I think BOOKS are what the front-line artists working on the Crazy Project are really hammering out.|update/addendum: I wrote this when DFW was still alive. It pains me to even go back and read this review -- \\\"one of the most fascinating authors alive\\\". I can reliably drop the last word of that now. DFW's suicide still stings like no other artist for me. I do know I'm not alone there, a lot of people who admire his work feel it. We were robbed -- it's selfish, incredibly so, but so is suicide.|Objectively, I still think Girl With Curious Hair is probably the best place to start, but I didn't start there, I started here, and it worked out okay. Just know this is a glorious mess, be patient with it, the book wants to be your daddy, but you have to be its daddy, let it teach you as you guide it it -- it's a living thing, this book, all the more precious now. Know what they say about novels such as Infinite Jest: Don\\u2019t seek Perfection or Pleasure but rather seek the Infinite Possibilities.|I have a lot to say about this book but before that there\\u2019s a little I don\\u2019t want to say about it. Here it is:|\\u263dThis book is never ending.|\\u263dIt bored me at times too.|\\u263dSome of the end notes were annoying.|\\u263dI read many other books when I was supposed to read this book.|\\u263dWhenever somebody asked me what IJ was all about, I was unable to come up with a clear-cut answer.|\\u263dI skipped few lines here and there.|\\u263dI think those who haven\\u2019t read this book or won\\u2019t read it, would have more or less incomplete existence as a reader.|\\u263dI think those who have read the whole book and still think it\\u2019s no good are..well\\u2026just normal I guess.|\\u263dNo reason is good enough for not reading this book.|\\u263dIn spite of best of my efforts my mind diverted to DFW\\u2019s suicide.|\\u263dI had thoughts of trying marijuana (it\\u2019s not really a big deal in India).|\\u263dAfter reading few reviews here, I got panic attacks due to their awesomeness.|\\u263dThis review went out of hand and got a \\u2018bit\\u2019 long, so oops.|\\u263dI don\\u2019t want to say cheesy lines like:| -If IJ was a country, I\\u2019d applied for a permanent residency; or| -If IJ was a drug, I\\u2019d get high forever; or| -If IJ was a guy, I\\u2019d marry him; or| -I\\u2019m already missing reading it.|\\u263dI laughed when I said to myself after finishing it, \\u201clet me get my thoughts in order.\\u201d|\\u263dThe good news is you can read IJ again and again.

Forster said,| \\u201cOne always tends to overpraise a long book, because one has got through it.\\u201d|Though I\\u2019m sure he didn\\u2019t have a book like IJ in mind, but I agree with him to some extent. Reading a long book means devoting a substantial time of your life, a time which you value and there\\u2019s no way one would like to declare that he/she/it spent that time on something unworthy. But when the book is Infinite Jest, then it deserves every iota of praise bestowed upon it. Its reading experience is something like the author takes your hand, makes you sit in front of a mirror and whisper in your ear, \\u201cnow see the magic\\u201d and lo, you\\u2019re sucked in by the mirror and the next moment you find yourself in a strange yet surprisingly familiar land and slowly the images, the scenery, the words starts unfolding themselves and you need to look out at each direction, else you\\u2019ll be lost. You need to examine a life, which was left unexamined for a long time.| |Day of finishing Infinite Jest|Jan 25, 2013 at around 2200hrs, I finished reading this book, closed it and put it aside. I stared at it for a while, then logged on to goodreads, gave it 5 stars, put it under my favorites shelf and asked myself, \\u201cWell what was that all about?\\u201d There was no answer in response but just an echo of words:|to write something that stabs you in the heart. That pierces you, makes you think you're going to die.|Day of starting reading Infinite jest| There was a sudden knock on the door. I woke up with a start and reluctantly went to open the door. An adolescent boy promptly asked, \\\"Do you want to get entertained?\\\" \\\"Huh.. what the .. ?\\\" I slammed the door shut and went back to sleep. Few hours passed but again my sleep broke on hearing some loud cheering. I went out and much to my surprise there was a whole tennis court in front of me and two players were busy playing. There was a group of boys snorting coke sitting round the corner and on the opposite stands, some kind of class was going on. I recognized that it was Arthur Ashe stadium, but couldn\\u2019t place the players. I looked at the score board: Wal and Fed. Wal was apparently leading with 6-3, 7-6, 5-3. Somebody tapped on my shoulder. He was the same boy. This time he handed me a book. I took it and immediately lost my balance. The alarm of my cell phone went off at that precise moment and welcomed me back to reality. Once the feeling of vertigo subsided, I checked the date. December 1, 2012. I said to myself, |Of course!|The days in between|Over the period of almost two months, I read IJ every day. Having read |Girl with curious hair| and |A supposedly fun thing I'll never do again| I experienced both fiction and non-fiction writing by Wallace and loved it. It proved to be a boon because if nothing else, the disjointed stories in IJ were something like short stories from Girl... (although a lot more developed and maturely handled) and the long ramblings on different topics reminded me of essays in a Supposedly fun\\u2026so Yes! Reading Wallace\\u2019s other works before attempting this book did help a lot more than I expected. There was something that made him work for me, which not only provided enjoyment but became a great source of knowledge and it won't be an exaggeration to say that I have found a book that shall remain with me both physically and emotionally throughout this modest and unexciting life of mine.| |Infinite Jest is not a work of a genius. It\\u2019s the work of someone who was all set to change the definition of word genius as we know it. He created a world that was consistently dark, desolate and most of the times demented but also witty, ingenious and oh so funny. This magnum opus is incredibly challenging but at the same time surprisingly accessible. It won\\u2019t let the reader sit back, relax and enjoy it. It\\u2019s no beach read but want its readers to sit up and take notice about what is going on. You can\\u2019t afford to lose focus and track but the probability is that you\\u2019ll lose both anyway. It\\u2019s that kind of book, a literary equivalent of mobiusism, a never ending quest, a once in a lifetime experience. By expressing all this, I\\u2019m in no way glorifying its completion by me, but simply stating the facts. It\\u2019s not possible to overestimate this book. |Wallace took the most wretched situations and characters and created such amazing backdrops, that in spite of everything so seemingly hopeless, he would still be able to present you with a glimpse of hope. In face of lot of desperate moves, he would teach you a lesson or two in patience. With so many impossibilities going on one after the other, he would tell what all is possible if one try to do just one thing: Realize. |His prose is exuberant with less scope of comfort. He won\\u2019t surround you with the sea of beautiful flowing writing to make you feel that he has stated something profound but rather something relentless and contemporary that you\\u2019re in a position to relate in both subjective and objective way, no matter how insane that way is. You\\u2019ll lose count of neologism, solecism, colloquialism, malapropism, and many other \\u2013isms DFW employed within IJ, which not only proves fascinating but gives you an idea about the extent to which he allowed himself to experiment in order to say whatever he wanted to and you\\u2019ll see how effortless it all looks as if DFW was telling something that\\u2019s always been there and getting our attention by a simple psst-look-here expression. Dave Eggers in his wonderful foreword rightly stated: |A Wallace reader gets the impression of being in a room with a very talkative and brilliant uncle or cousin, who, just when he\\u2019s about to push it too far, to try our patience with too much detail, has the good sense to throw in a good low-brow joke.|He has employed an |allegorical structure| to this novel and develops it to an extraordinary proportion taking cues from many of his influences namely Joyce, Pynchon, Shakespeare and Dante to name a few.|I don\\u2019t want to indulge much into plot(s), but just a brief and my practice in brevity, if I\\u2019m allowed. IJ primarily takes place in futuristic USA circa 2009-10 in Boston city. The setting for majority of the narration is based at Enfield Tennis Academy (ETA) and Ennet House, a drug and alcohol recovery house, where majority of the interesting characters reside, situating nearby ETA. ETA was founded by James. O. Incandenza, an avant-garde film maker, whose wife, Avril Incandenza heads the academy with their 2 sons, Mario and Hal being the current attendees of the ETA while their eldest brother, Orin being a previous attendee, now a punter in the NFL. Orin is a jerk, Mario is great and Hal is lonely. Avril is beautiful, very tall and delusional about her kids; James was taller, committed suicide and knew his kids just too well. He created a film known as The Entertainment, titled \\\"Infinite Jest\\\", which rumored to have |\\u2019qualities\\u2019 such that whoever saw it wanted nothing else ever in life but to see it again, then again and so on|, rendering its audience fatally addicted to it. The quest of finding the master copy of this entertainment marks the entry of a group of Quebecois separatists in the book, known as Les Assassins des Fauteuils Rollents a.k.a Wheelchair Assassins or simply A.F.R, who wants to obtain a copy, which they called |Samizdat| , because of its lethal qualities that would make them dangerously powerful to meet their extremist goals. This group gave me creeps. |The book is mostly covered with Wallace commentary about drug addiction through myriad eccentric and bizarre characters at the Ennet House. Wallace presents the intake of drugs, its effects and substance withdrawal i.e. cold turkey in such merciless detail that one can\\u2019t help to actually empathize with those involved in substance abuse. Apart from drugs, there\\u2019s some wonderful description about depression, clinical depression to be precise. Here\\u2019s one of my favorite passage which I\\u2019ve tagged as spoiler | \\\"The so-called 'psychotically depressed' person who tries to kill herself doesn't do so out of quote 'hopelessness' or any abstract conviction that life's assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire's flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It's not desiring the fall; it's terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling 'Don't!' and 'Hang on!', can understand the jump. Not really. You'd have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.\\\"|. At this point one can\\u2019t help feeling for David\\u2019s own struggle with depression and the justification of the eventual step he took. |With drugs and depression, there are AA meetings and telling of stories, some of which are so despicably ugly and dismal that it would make you think that you were better off without reading them. Then of course there is tennis and the pressure this competitive game induces on young minds but also tells how a thin line exists that separates Tennis with real life: | Tennis's beauty's infinite roots are self-competitive. You compete with your own limits to transcend the self in imagination and execution. Disappear inside the game: break through limits: transcend: improve: win.| |At ETA, through characters like Hal and Michael Pemulis, one gets the picture of how youngsters so easily resort to wrong paths, which could adversely affect their coming lives a sample of which could be witnessed through Ennet House residents. So in my opinion it won\\u2019t be wrong to say that Wallace, in a masterful way presented a connection between past, present and future of different promising lives, which got destroyed because of the few choices wrongly made. At Ennet House, characters like Don Gately convey that despite being wrongdoers, they are good human beings at heart and are just a product of godforsaken circumstances amidst which they were born and at the same house there are people like Randy Lenz who are nothing less than a personification of devil. |From IJ, one gets a fitting impression of David's capability and scope as a writer. There could be nothing more challenging in picking the most undesired and ugly elements of the universe and weave them together and creating characters and situations of such unbelievable contrast that the end product dwelling them makes even a stone heart to wail in sympathy or reach a point of such profound epiphany that brings a huge turn around in your life. He won\\u2019t present you with anything normal but something lovable nevertheless. What\\u2019s the most important thing that can happen after reading IJ? The world around you changes for better or for worse. One tends to acquire a whole new point of view of looking at people and can\\u2019t help thinking, Well, what could be their story? |The most incredible example of David\\u2019s talent can be seen through James O. Incandenza\\u2019s filmography that is dripping with excruciatingly weird but magnificently witty ideas. I admit that there was not much I could relate with in great depth but there was a benign captivation about the whole text. My love for tennis and movies (especially Lynchian) wasn\\u2019t the biggest support system and well, I\\u2019m not even American or Qu\\u00e9b\\u00e9cois, so all the more less relief nevertheless my motivation mainly rest with David\\u2019s writing and the thought of reading a work of literature which is unique in a daunting yet immensely fulfilling manner. It\\u2019s true that this novel is full of extraneous ramblings but they are not invasive to the main text. If you learn to like his writing, you will love everything written by him, well almost everything. I had my small issues with few things but I\\u2019m ready to overlook them. Moreover a clever move by Wallace can be identifiable in the manner of his use of so many \\u2018errors\\u2019 in different context. I know they were mainly attributed to various characters, but again, in a book so huge, the margin of error automatically increases, which could easily be neglect during editing too. So instead of sifting such errors out, Wallace made them the part of his work. If I\\u2019ll give it a metaphoric angle as a result of some cogitation on my part, then it could also be seen as life, which can\\u2019t be led without its due share of some big errors. After all that\\u2019s what being human is all about. |One thing I can confidently say about his writing is that in this book, his prose though seemingly reckless at times, is an intentional move on his part. You\\u2019ll see the range and depth of his skills throughout. Agreed that most of the topics covered had some deep connection with David personal life but that's exactly it makes it all the more brilliant as we get to read someone who had a lucid and precise view of what he had to say. Though I have read that this thing doesn\\u2019t sit well with many, but that\\u2019s what reading DFW means. A blogger rightly commented: | So many of his critics never realized the writer's relentless and extravagant prose was a deliberate and incredibly risky attempt to present reality as he experienced it, which was so vast and multi-layered as to make sharing it with another person who was experiencing a similar influx, an astonishing feat.|Infinite Jest, among many things is homage to sobriety, happiness, loneliness, sadness and truth. For some, staying sober is happiness and for some |feeling| is happiness. Some will be happy in knowing the truth and some, in telling of the truth. | The trick is keeping the truth up-front in daily consciousness.|He brilliantly captured the fatuous nature of residents of a country in this era of pop culture in a flamboyant yet amazingly restrained manner that one can\\u2019t help but feel the pain of the injury the text inflict upon the minds of its readers. |It's like watching a reality sit-com over a surveillance camera|, is one concise description I particularly like. A work of literature that was born to become immortal and shall teach you what all can be done with words and what power lies within the realm of writing. |My reading experience was more or less steady and enriching. Gradually through the main contents, I noticed the book weight shifting from my right hand to the left (though it happened a lot many times considering the endnotes) and reaching the last page and with that last page I realized, there\\u2019s plenty to come yet. Denouement and IJ doesn\\u2019t go together in the most conventional sense. There was a lot more left to \\u2018figure out\\u2019. Before referring to external sources, I wanted to put together as many pieces of this bizarre puzzle at their right places. It was getting unbearable somehow. I was getting afraid what if I would fail or what if after \\u2018getting the jest\\u2019 I won\\u2019t laugh. And it was then it dawned upon me that every reader of this book becomes a part of it in such a way, that it won\\u2019t let you fail. \\u2018A Failed Entertainment\\u2019 was the working title for David Foster Wallace's \\u201cInfinite Jest\\u201d; and I\\u2019m glad he didn\\u2019t go for that, because I think he produced an entertainment so painfully addictive that It won\\u2019t be easy to withdraw from it and consequently can't be regarded as a failure. One would carry one thing or the other out of it. There are many loose ends that are not being tied, may be because they are meant to be honored in isolation. The whole thing would turn up as fogged mirror, which only you can clean to see an image, either unbearably beautiful or unbearably ugly. Till that time, live accordingly to the image you want to see at the end. And here\\u2019s me hoping that one day I\\u2019ll \\u2018get the jest\\u2019 in toto. I'm so glad that this book exists. I was going to make a cheeky post about how the best way to enjoy |Infinite Jest| is to be a white cishet American male born between maybe 1969 and 1989 with one or more diagnosable mental disorders plus personal experience with substance abuse and who remembers when VHS tape rewinders were peak technology. But in fact the best way to enjoy |Infinite Jest| is right there in the title: just read it over, and over, and over again...|(all that other stuff helps plenty, though)|SEVENTH READTHROUGH REVIEW:|ME2ME, A 5 A.M.

I'll talk your ear off about this one if given half a chance.|MY FIRST REVIEW, JANUARY 2016:|There are books and then there are BOOKS.|Once I told a friend that my mom's favorite book was \\\"Atlas Shrugged\\\" and my friend said she was just trying to impress me with page count. Some might feel the same about \\\"Infinite Jest\\\", which boasts 1079 pages (981 of prose and the remaining 98 all footnotes). It's experimental, it's self-aware, and it's complex. Or it's not complex so much as detailed. Overdetailed. Hyperdetailed. But it's also apologetic, like the author knows he's got something really important to say and he's just so terribly sorry to bother you with it in this way. Maybe knowing that the writer later killed himself colors my opinion, but the whole book is infused with gravitas. There are scenes full of energy and others that are boring in their normalcy, yet it's all described in baroque intricacy that makes the mundane seem powerfully important.|\\\"Infinite Jest\\\" is the story of Hal Incandenza, a teenage tennis prodigy from an affluent Massachusetts family, who briefly visits an addicts' halfway house. It's also the story of Don Gately, a reformed thief who finds an unpleasant but effective recovery through the same house's 12-step programs and becomes a hero in the process. It's also also the story of a secret short film so addictively entertaining that anyone who watches it dies, slowly wasting away as they freeze catatonic and unable to turn it off. And it's also also also about all the context in between and around and behind all that, like the recent war that forced all the North American countries to merge, and the way Hal's father killed himself after filming the film in question, and the Canadian wheelchair assassin squad seeking to find the master copy so they can weaponize it.|\\\"Infinite Jest\\\" reminds us of what words can do, what books can be, what serious-literature-as-art looks like. I admit, I had to turn to the Internet early on to search for some clarification. But even that foray into cyberspace felt right, like the text was only enhanced as time moved us all ahead into a fully digital age. It's all part of the experience, and \\\"Infinite Jest\\\" is absolutely that: an experience. Anyone who has finished it seems to remember where they were when they did, sometimes if only because of all the other things they weren't able to do because they spent so much time reading it. My copy comes with an introduction by Dave Eggers who compares it to exercise, and that's a very apt comparison. Reading it is like flexing your brain muscles. It's not quite like lifting weights but rather more like posing in front of the mirror and thinking \\\"I look good.\\\"|I admit also that I skimmed some sections. I skimmed much of the minutiae of the tennis academy routines. I skimmed the plodding Eschaton games. I skimmed the goofy puppet show film and the political farce of how O.N.A.N. got set up. These are worldbuilding scenes bloated out of control, methodical and tiresome and pretty damn boring. And the phone conversations between Hal and Orin? Please. Nobody talks like that.|On the other hand, I was riveted by the scenes in the addicts' house and at the Boston AA meetings. And I was transfixed by the delightful passages with Lyle, the locker room guru who maybe can hover and gives out sage advice to troubled teens at the tennis academy. And I laughed out loud when I read about the feral hamsters breeding in the nuclear wastes, among other things. The prose could surely benefit from a trim, a couple pages here or a dozen there to help speed the narrative along. And those footnotes aren't particularly illuminating; I stopped checking them very early on and my understanding didn't suffer any. Maybe this is all an artistic choice\\u2014if the book is truly about life in America and how we're all escapists trying to endlessly entertain ourselves to distract from the unpleasant thought of our inevitable death, as the critical consensus appears to be, then these long stretches of dull text must reflect a singular truth about living in reality: there's plenty of parts of life itself we'd love to skip over, right? But we can't. We are bound to continue on forwards one minute at a time.|So, in the end, what to say? Is it perfect? Well, no. But it is dramatic and perception-altering and significant. The depictions of addiction and depression resonate deeply. It is absolutely touching and Very Important. But it's not easy, and I don't know that it's very re-readable, even though a second reading is strongly encouraged as the ending loops right back around to the beginning a la \\\"Finnegan's Wake\\\". You could just keep reading through and starting over and jumping right back down the rabbit hole, as it were, which is very appropriate given the exploration of addiction and the symbolism of the mystery movie.|2 of 5 as a work of entertainment, 5 of 5 as a work of art, and thus 4 of 5 stars from me overall.|* * *|OK, OK!

I think there's enough universal human truth to serve as a foundation upon which the rest can sit. But if hard-pressed, I would have to admit that IJ may not deserve a spot in the fabled Canon Of Great Works. Maybe it's not Great, maybe it's merely Very Very Good. And yet, it stands apart as unique, as an exceptionally well-crafted piece of art (I daresay even Art, with a capital A). Every detail is balanced and counterweighted with exacting precision and care. It's not just long for the hell of it.|This is DFW's great trick: to write a novel so lengthy that it encompasses and mimics several distinct experiences. There's the \\\"everyday life\\\" experience of finding great detail in the minutae of everyday living. There's the mimicry of the high-def films that JOI supposedly composed, with great depth of focus in each scene. There's the experience of the recovering addict, the \\\"huge slabs of glacial time\\\" that Gately now experiences, counting seconds as they tick by. There's the giddy thrill of occasional spurts of action, of a mystery that never quite comes together. And there's the dizzying array of seemingly endless interconnections between tragically lonely people who don't actually connect and yet whose narratives overlap and cascade in unforseeable ways.|So, were I to stand IJ up in relation to every other Great Western Novel, I'd get self-conscious and give it a 4. But this book has become a part of me, has articulated experiences and feelings that I've had in a way that is almost painfully beautiful, and challenges my way of thinking not only while reading but afterwards.|5 stars.|FOURTH READTHROUGH REVIEW|\\\"...little more than an olla podrida of depressive conceits strung together with flashy lensmanship and perspectival novelty.\\\" (791)|\\\"...the complete unfiguranted egalitarian aural realism was why party-line entertainment-critics always complained that the wraith's entertainments' public-area scenes were always incredibly dull and self-conscious and irritating, that they could never hear the really meaningful central narrative conversations for all the unfiltered babble of the peripheral crowd, which they assumed the babble(/babel) was some self-conscious viewer-hostile heavy-art directorial pose, instead of radical realism.\\\" (836)|This is my fourth reading of |Infinite Jest| and I'm very pleased to say I've come to a fuller and more satisfying understanding of both the key plot points and the thematic interrelation of the various strands and settings. I think I can satisfactorily say who the narrator is, who sent out the Entertainment cartridges and why, and |what happened to Hal in the end that left him incapacitated in the opening section| \\u2013 although for each of these questions there is still a tantalizing ambiguity that obscures any real, firm answers. I think I can express how this is a modern retelling (and arguably inversion) of |Hamlet|. I think I can fully grok the parallels between competitive athleticism, political fanaticism, and drug addiction/recovery. I think I can appreciate how self-referential and sly winking jokes like Himself's filmography and Found Drama and annular fusion and endnotes within endnotes are both the ultimate manifestation of and the jumping-off point for moving past Postmodernism and its alleged toxic effect on meaningful human contact. To get to this point I had to read the text three times through, listen to it once as an audiobook, and spend hours and hours reading critical analyses and online community reader responses. But what's amazing is how much I enjoyed doing this, spending so much time with this book as a personal mission and a source of entertainment and a means of enlightenment through literary critique. I am not exaggerating when I say that |Infinite Jest| inspired me to be a better person, challenged me to identify areas of my life in which I had grown complacent, and turned me into a rabid convert who will evangelize its worth to anybody willing to listen.|But I think I understand why people dislike this book. Despite its reputation as a comedy, it's not especially funny, really, and in fact often seems designed to be joyless. The humor that is on display is what we'd call \\\"gallows humor\\\" and it's delivered in dense, maximalist prose. Everybody knows that brevity is the soul of wit and the best jokes are often one-liners or come in a quick setup/punchline delivery. Here we've got the opposite: long-winded, over-detailed, extremely analytical buildups to a punchline that's either passed by quickly or buried within a long explanation full of caveats, clarifications, and trivia. So you're not often going to laugh, really\\u2014maybe some smirks and at best a chortle but not a lot of knee-slapping.|And for all the really truly excellent passages (the history of videophony, \\\"Tennis and the Feral Prodigy,\\\" the M*A*S*H-inspired downward spiral of Steepley's father, Clipperton's Glock, JOI's father's drunken rambling garage-set monologue, the redemption of Barry Loach) there are some really truly not excellent passages, too. Stuff that seems experimental in an unrefined college undergrad kind of way (\\\"Here is a list of things that are blue,\\\" the wince-and-cringe faux-ebonics of \\\"Wardine be cry,\\\" the too long and too cribbed-from-an-urban-legend email chain about a bricklayer's accident). Some of these post-modern-type experimental prose formats do not hang well together, and give the text a choppy feel. Supposedly this was DFW's intent\\u2014but we give him a lot of leeway on intent, I think, often apologizing for things that actually weren't 100% successful in their execution. The \\\"yrstruly\\\" section gets my vote for worst offender here.|Plus, there are a lot of shocking and backward-seeming tendencies on display that will doubtless ostracize non-white, non-straight, non-male readers. The casual use of \\\"faggy\\\" as an insult and the one-dimensionality of any of the gay characters, the \\\"big man in unconvincing drag\\\" running joke. The peppering of racial slurs and stereotyping. These are not enlightened views and they don't hold up under scrutiny as attempting to satirize or shock for the purpose of social change. I think DFW just thought that stuff was funny, in an immature way. And yeah, I'll give him a bit of slack since that really was the way people talked in the 90's and in particular in Boston which is hardly a hotbed of tolerance or acceptance. But I really think that these traits work against the book's reputation in the long-term and mark it as a period piece. I bet DFW would regret these race and gender elements in particular and revise them heavily, if not excise them completely, were he writing it today. Because for such an important message as how difficult it is to truly communicate and how valuable empathy is in human relations, you can't display such wanton ignorance and expect to get through to people. We've also got the troubling issue of Wallace's real-life actions being far from model behavior\\u2014he was at best an asshole and at worst a criminal stalker\\u2014and whether that undercuts his message here, especially since he seemed to be striving to pour himself into this work and shatter the standard literary critic's conception of the Intentional Fallacy as a sacred cow of sorts.|For me, this is still a 5 star book. But it emphasizes the \\\"for me\\\" aspect of any experience, and I can appreciate where it falls flat or fails to be accessible to contemporary audiences. For me, I'm extremely glad I've read it and chewed on it so aggressively. Maybe now, having wrestled and danced with it so long, I can put the book aside for a while and go out and do what it's really exhorting us to do: live life, don't just watch it.|SIXTH READTHROUGH REVIEW|Never have I ever disliked so much a book I enjoy, nor for that matter so enjoyed such a dislikable book. I should have hated this book. 1079 pages of small text with loooooonnnnggggg paragraphs and little white space so it feels like you\\u2019re reading a newspaper from 1881. Plus, 96 goddamn pages of endnotes. *1 The plot, such as it is, doesn\\u2019t really come into focus until several hundred pages into it, and even though it\\u2019s set in the near future where something very strange has happened in North America, this doesn\\u2019t get explained until about mid-way through the book so you\\u2019re left feeling confused and bewildered a lot of the time. |There\\u2019s an almost endless cast of characters. Long sections of the book have detailed descriptions of things that don\\u2019t seem crucial to the plot. *2 And then there\\u2019s the fact you have to use two bookmarks because you\\u2019re constantly going back to the endnotes. *3 Some of the endnotes contain long wandering passages that also don\\u2019t seem relevant to anything. *4|The ending isn\\u2019t very satisfying. *5 The main plot point about the search for a cartridge of \\u2018entertainment\\u2019 so good that it will literally make anyone who sees it immediately stop living their live and stay in front of the television until they die because they\\u2019ll refuse to do anything but watch it, including eating, drinking, using the toilet, etc. *6, isn\\u2019t given much resolution, either.|The book just kind of stops, and you have the distinct impression that DFW could have done another 1000 pages or so without breaking a sweat if he hadn\\u2019t eventually eliminated his own map. *7|So after all that, why was my first instinct after finishing it to go back and immediately start re-reading it? *8|I was completely engrossed when I was reading this book. No matter what weird detours it took, I was more than happy to just keep turning pages like one of those poor suckers who got snared by The Entertainment. If this book was endless *9, I probably would have spent my life cheerfully reading it and then asked for a copy on my deathbed just to try and squeeze a few more pages in.|I\\u2019m not sure why I liked it so much. In fact, the way this book got into my head gives me a slight case of the howling fantods *10 Considering it\\u2019s a book that deals a lot with obsession, this is more than a little unsettling.|I\\u2019m sure someone with an English degree could spend the rest of their life trying to deconstruct this book, but I don\\u2019t have the intelligence, skill or patience to even try. Wallace did something unique and crazy with this, and he had the talent to make it work. I don\\u2019t know how, and I think that figuring it out might be like when you learn how a magic trick was done so I\\u2019m just going to shelve it, always be glad that I took it on and managed to finish it, and re-read it someday once the memory of the endless pages of endnotes has faded. * 11|Oh, and I would have given it 5 stars, but you know, the endnote thing\\u2026 *12|*1 - Yes, 96 goddamn pages.| |*2 - I now know way more about tennis drills and Alcoholics Anonymous than I ever really wanted to learn.|*3 - Seriously, there are 388 endnotes in this freaking thing.|*4 - There\\u2019s an 8 page filmography listing all the movies that were supposed to have been made by one of the characters.|*5 - Somebody email me and explain what the hell happened.|*6 - The closest comparison would probably be a really kick-ass episode of The Wire or Battlestar Galactica.|*7 - \\u2018Eliminating maps\\u2019 is a slang phrase from the book meaning to either kill someone or kill yourself.| |*8 - I didn\\u2019t.

Reading |Infinite Jest| feels a bit like when you\\u2019ve had some friends over for dinner, you\\u2019ve all had a jolly good time, it\\u2019s getting a bit late though, the guests are leaving one after the other, and but there is this one guy, a brilliant guy, a bit of a show-off, to be honest, a kind of beefy guy you wouldn\\u2019t want to mess up with too much, and, above all, a horrifyingly garrulous guy. And he is lying there on your couch, slowly but steadily draining your liquor cabinet, and droning on and on, and oh! but it\\u2019s already 4 a.m., and everyone else is long gone, and he is still there telling all sorts of rambling anecdotes you can\\u2019t make head nor tail of, so but then at some point your eyes start itching like real bad and he\\u2019s babbling and pouring himself another glass of Wild Turkey, and at length, you accidentally drift off and, as you suddenly jump back and open your eyes, the guy is still relentlessly talking, the tide in your drink cabinet is \\u201cway out\\u201d, and meanwhile, you realise rosy-fingered Dawn is rising across your dead-bottles-littered living room... And but then, right at that moment, out of the blue, in the middle of his sentence, that conversationalist from hell glances at his watch, mumbles something about it being already 1079h or some such, gets up, grabs his coat and leaves. And so but so you realise you really need a fucking shower. |Now in all earnestness, |Infinite Jest| is a pretty beefy beast. And it\\u2019s not just a matter of length (just about one thousand densely-laid-out pages + another thick, even tighter cushion of endnotes). The material, the style, the composition are a challenge to the reader as well. It is quite clear that David Foster Wallace is insanely talented and capable of pulling out all the stops literary-wise: a variety of styles and speech patterns and dialects, unearthly situations, deeply layered characters, several-pages-long sentences that still manage to make sense and remain grammatically sound, a blend of casual phrasing and hyper-scholarly pedantic jargon and neologisms, bits and bobs of French (in fact, French-sounding but laced with blunders and mostly borderline gibberish), sudden left turns from hilarious to grotesque to horrifying, and the list goes on.|On the other hand, |Infinite Jest| is in toto and quite literally a puzzling novel \\u2014 a giant 1,000 piece jigsaw with missing bits. It seems as if DWF had been writing this monster haphazardly, throwing one scene after the next on paper, all over the map, introducing one character after another, without much consideration for any form of consistency or reason or storytelling technique or quite knowing what he was doing. As if he had been throwing stuff against the wall to see what would stick, and in the end, just left everything in (allegedly, he removed some 600 pages from the initial manuscript before publication, but still!). As a result, the book is rhapsodic, bloated, and seems to display a disjointed and sometimes irritating and gratuitous series of vignettes, anecdotes, dreams, hallucinations, esoteric digressions, silly acronyms and endnotes, winks to |Homer| and |Shakespeare| and |Dostoyevsky| and |Joyce| and |Nabokov| and |Pynchon| and |Bazin| and |Deleuze| and |Scorsese| and |Lynch|. In other words, a jumble of bits and pieces of attempts that, in some cases, would and, in others, wouldn\\u2019t adhere so much to the rest of the picture. In essence, perhaps, a \\u201cstupefyingly turgid-sounding shit\\u201d (p. 911)? This holds even to the very end, which doesn\\u2019t provide any sense of closure or resolution or |Gestalt|. The novel ends |in medias res|, as abruptly and randomly as it started. In other words, it doesn\\u2019t end.|So, for the most part, the readers of this sprawling and baroque novel are expected to hone their understanding and piece all this material together into something that might make some sense. As the narrator puts it at some point (talking about something else), |Infinite Jest| sometimes feels to have \\u201cno narrative movement toward a real story; no emotional movement toward an audience\\u201d (p. 740). But in the end, and as a result of the sheer length and complicated, disorderly structure, they might find that, although their patience has been tried to the nth degree, there is still a sort of power of accretion which, for want of producing a proper story, does indeed paint the picture of a whole epoch: our time.|Infinite Jest| is an insane form of speculative fiction. The story takes place in some trippy dystopian alternate reality, where North America has become one single country, governed by a halfwitted show-business-celebrity president (rings a bell?), where mindless consumerism is rampant \\u2014 even the Gregorian calendar and the Statue of Liberty have become ad spaces \\u2014 and massive amounts of toxic rubbish and radioactive pollution are catapulted into a large chunk of territory to the N-E Appalachian Mountains, turned into a giant Chernobyl-like landfill. It is also a book featuring (among other things): the daily life of a bunch of kids at an upscale Tennis Academy, a multi-generational family saga (the Incandenzas \\u2014 compare to, say, the Buend\\u00edas in |One Hundred Years of Solitude|), a series of wrecks at a drug and alcohol rehab centre, and a group of French-Canadian terrorists.|Most characters in |Infinite Jest| seem utterly miserable, suicidal, damaged, depressed, obsessed, lonely, lost. The book is also, in a way, an existential study about the struggle of being human in our postmodern reality. But in my view, at the core, |Infinite Jest| is a book about addiction and its devastating effects. That is addiction in all imaginable forms and shapes: drugs, alcohol, sex, success, mindless entertainment, so on. One of the central and most fascinating threads in this novel is about a movie that is so very entertaining and compelling that anyone who starts watching it won\\u2019t be able to stop watching it again, on a loop, to death \\u2014 the wild dream of any media and entertainment tycoon, no doubt. Incidentally, that movie is titled |Infinite Jest|.|In a way, |Infinite Jest| (the movie within the novel) illustrates the most extreme version of addiction. |Infinite Jest| (the book), on the other hand, is a stark satire of a society that has become the slave of cheap and mind-numbing, soul-destroying pleasures, force-fed to everyone by a capitalist system that pretends to bring happiness to humankind but is in actuality driven to endless consumerism only.|And so, |Infinite Jest| is ultimately a book about literature as a form of art and as an industry. |Infinite Jest| (the novel) is radically, obsessively antiformulaic, \\u201canticonfluential\\u201d (to use one of the narrator\\u2019s terms); it doesn\\u2019t pretend, doesn\\u2019t try to provide, even denies the reader any form of low-grade, profit-oriented, passivity-inducing, addiction-inducing literary pleasure. In short, |Infinite Jest| (the novel) is the direct opposite of |Infinite Jest| (the movie within the novel).|Ironically though, the book\\u2019s publication was intensely marketed and hyped in the US (as a comedy, mind you, which cannot be further from the truth!); it has become, in most English-speaking countries, especially since DFW sadly \\u201celiminated his own map\\u201d, a cult bestseller of sorts. 2015 Book I was Most Afraid to Hate|I read 11%.

Do you resent being obliged to endure? I've finally reached the end of this amazing book. It's not an easy read, but after a while you discover that there are good reasons why it has to be the way it is. |The review is the mini-blog I kept while I was reading it. It sort of contains spoilers: I don't give away very much about the plot, but I do spend a lot of time speculating about what the overall point of the book is. So if that kind of thing bothers you, you probably shouldn't read on. Read |Infinite Jest| instead, then come back and see if you agree with me :)|The rest of this review is in my book |What Pooh Might Have Said to Dante and Other Futile Speculations|  It's now been more than two years since I began |Infinite Jest| and about 10 months since I finished it. In all that time, the scene that has stuck with me the most is one where a character, attempting to go to a 12-step meeting for a drug addiction, goes astray and ends up at what is actually a \\\"men's movement\\\" meeting. A relic of the 1990s, the men's movement was a chance for men to get together and show their sensitive sides to one another, or allow their inner warriors or their inner children to commune with each other, or some such thing\\u2014it was short-lived and I can't quite remember what its exact aim was. The joke is that it takes a while for the main character to figure out where he's ended up, but as the men take turns speaking, eventually the horror of the situation slowly dawns on him. Why this scene has stuck with me, I don't know\\u2014it's dated, it's trying way too hard to be funny, and it's got nothing to do with much of anything. |On the other hand, perhaps it's a perfect encapsulation of |Infinite Jest| itself, which, by and large, is dated, trying way too hard to be funny, and has nothing to do with much of anything.|As you may know, |Infinite Jest| has three storylines. One concerns a videotape (or \\\"cartridge\\\") that so addicts viewers that they can't stop watching it and, unable to do any of the things people normally do to stay alive, eventually perish. The master of this videotape is being sought by both U.S. government agencies and terrorist organizations. The second storyline concerns some kids at a tennis academy; the father of two of these kids, a famous filmmaker, is the creator of the aforementioned addictive cartridge. The third concerns a residential drug-rehab center near the tennis academy, one resident of which, Don Gately, could be considered the heart and soul of the book.|These three storylines do connect in some ways, and all of them have the potential to be interesting. But unfortunately, very little of the book lives up to this potential. Most of the scenes concerning the cartridge are tedious and repetitive. Most of the scenes concerning the tennis academy are tedious, although not quite as repetitive. Generally the only interesting scenes are the ones that involve Don Gately and the rehab center. Interspersed among all of these storylines are many, many tangents involving other minor characters; some of these scenes are interesting, most aren't, and all of them slow down the main stories. Also slowing down the main stories are the copious endnotes, which frequently force the narrative to come to a screeching halt, often for no good reason. In a way, it's a perfect book for people with no attention span, so perhaps DFW actually foresaw how the internet would lead to most of our reading being done in interruptive fragments. Unfortunately, this particular insight, if accurate, absolutely did not make the book any less exasperating to read.|The odd structure of |Infinite Jest| made me very curious about its editing process, so after I was finally done I picked up the DFW biography |Every Love Story Is a Ghost Story|, where I learned that there was essentially no editing process for this book. DFW seemed to throw in every idea and bit of writing he'd ever had, adding up to hundreds and hundreds of pages, and his editor simply did his best to keep the book to a manageable length. Given that |Infinite Jest| is nearly 1100 pages including endnotes, I'd say the editor barely succeeded at that goal. What's more, the storylines don't really cohere and eventually\\u2014again, after many, many pages\\u2014just kind of fizzle out. |Every Love Story Is a Ghost Story| attempted to explain the book's structure, such as it is, and I'm going to try to paraphrase as well as I can: Picture a map of a state with all the counties marked. One county is a particular scene in the book. The book next travels to an adjacent county/scene, which has some connection to the first but is its own separate thing. Then the book travels to another adjacent county/scene, and so on. So all the counties/scenes are connected to at least one additional county/scene, but obviously there's not only no linearity here; there's no cohesive narrative in any way. Most themes, characters, and situations don't go back and make any of the connections you might hope for. Which might be OK if every county was a worthwhile place to be in, but that's not the case. Out of nearly 1100 pages, I would say maybe 300 or 400 are worth reading. Do the math and figure out if you've got that kind of time.|As I mentioned, the best parts of the book, for me and, it seems, for many other readers, are the scenes with Don Gately in the rehab center. There is a lot of wisdom about addictions dispensed here, and it's mostly riveting stuff. I assumed this was DFW sharing what he'd learned when he himself was in a similar rehab, but I turned out to be wrong\\u2014per |Every Love Story Is a Ghost Story|, Don Gately was actually based on someone DFW knew in rehab, and Gately's wisdom comes courtesy of this real person, who was none too pleased to learn that DFW had used him in this way. So some of the best parts of the book didn't really come from its author's own imagination or thought process, but rather from a powerless, disenfranchised, working-class person DFW cribbed off of. As you might imagine, learning this did little to increase my esteem for |Infinite Jest|.|This book is ambitious, for sure, but not ambitious enough. As other reviewers have noted, all of the characters, regardless of age, education, or background, sound pretty much the same. They sometimes use the same language, even when they've never met each other before\\u2014for a while everyone was saying \\\"diddled,\\\" for example, and then later on everyone was saying \\\"dickied,\\\" then, if I recall correctly, \\\"kertwang.\\\" I have no idea if this was intentional or just lazy, but it certainly read as the latter to me. The language is also often exceedingly juvenile (the acronym \\\"ONAN,\\\" for example, or a Japanese manufacturer called \\\"Yushitu\\\"). DFW also has a fondness for tweaking well-known expressions, so, for instance, \\\"under the table\\\" becomes \\\"sub-table\\\" and \\\"upwardly mobile\\\" becomes \\\"mobilely upward.\\\" It's entirely possible this sort of thing seemed more clever back in the 1990s.|The upshot is that instead of a really good 400-page book that the author had worked hard on revising and improving, we have a behemoth that can't stay focused on anything long enough to make a true impact. Oddly, DFW seems to realize this: Several times he includes a telling line or two. When considering the famous filmmaker's oeuvre, one character muses, \\\"Technically gorgeous.... But oddly hollow, empty, no sense of dramatic |towardness|\\u2014no narrative movement toward a real story.... like a very smart person conversing with himself.\\\" Or this line, regarding a random character who appears for a moment: \\\"the girl had a terrible time ever separating details from what was really important to a story.\\\" Or this one, about the filmmaker's work again: \\\"is the puzzlement and then boredom and then impatience and then excruciation and then near-rage aroused in the film's audience... aroused for some theoretical aesthetic end, or is Himself [the filmmaker] simply an amazingly shitty editor of his own stuff?\\\"|Indeed. That DFW seems to recognize these shortcomings in his own work, and actually include them in the narrative, is kind of cute and clever, I guess. But what would have been really great is if he'd actually addressed those shortcomings and come up with a book that was worthy of both his own obvious talents AND the reader's time and investment. Instead what we have is a novelist who insists on getting in his own way over and over again, and a missed opportunity as gargantuan as is the novel itself. 5/17/17 edit: I'm upgrading this one to 5 stars, because I still cannot stop thinking about it a year after finishing it. |There are 2 kinds of difficult novels: those that you don't enjoy |while| reading, but you genuinely enjoying |having| read, and those that you only enjoy |while| reading because the small picture stuff is infinitely better than the novel as a whole. Infinite Jest is one of the latter, and I think that's why people never really stop reading it; it's only good |while| you're reading it. You finish and then start right over again, trying to piece things together until you create something in your mind that slightly makes sense of it all.|This thing is a real love/hate affair. There are moments of true brilliance that are exceptional achievements, and the characters are fantastic, the world-building absolute top-notch, but if you have to leave the \\\"ending\\\" up to your audience to imagine in their collective heads instead of \\u2013 I don't know \\u2013 WRITING IT, you wrote yourself into a corner and didn't/couldn't write your way out.|Yes, I've gone back and read the first chapter after finishing it. Yes, I understand the chronology. Yes, I've read all the theories online. I get what probably happened, but how did it happen? Why did it happen? How did those strings and threads of story and plot actually come together? The answer is: they didn't. If I have to construct a way for all of this brilliant stuff to come together myself, it means that the author never did. It's just a hand-wavy sort of \\\"oh and then stuff happened and then the end\\\" cop-out.|There are threads in this book that insinuate all kinds of things, meaning that you can find evidence to setup any sort of ending that your heart desires, and it's just as valid as anyone else's theories, because there is no actual ending. Think Hal in that first chapter is actually Mario pretending to be Hal? They're both described as fire hydrant shaped, maybe he was. Think John Wayne was an AFR plant all along, AFR agents and John Wayne are both described by the same quotes from The Terminator, maybe he was. Or maybe none of that, because there isn't an ending, so we do not and will not ever know what actually happened. DFW created a piece of entertainment that once read, leaves the reader only wanting to read it again and again and again and again. It is an Infinite Jest.|Again, the brilliant stuff is so brilliant that I still enjoyed it immensely, and have to give this 5 stars, and I get that postmodernism is all about ontological vs. epistemological approaches to fiction, but good lord at least have it slightly wrap up just a tiny bit!

Not only did he know this, he was courageous enough to proclaim that he knew this from the highest rooftop, spilling out a novel that scoffs, declaims, and drowns the old conventions of making life this easy whore that only requires adherence to paper to make itself completely tangible and understandable in every way. Newsflash: That is Entertainment, Entertainment with a capital E, followed by the Infinite Jest, long lines of seconds bleeding themselves dry with gags, jokes, puns, witty remarks, comedic outbursts, impressive logistical maneuverings of physical feats, \\\"I got that reference!\\\", grasping in the dark after a fleeting feeling of actually being able to feel.

These people, they shame the \\\"psychotically depressed\\\", they box the sufferers up in a cynical outlook that doesn't allow them to treat their condition seriously, and the barest glimpse of a true outburst of \\\"feeling\\\" is quickly carted away and shut up in the walls of their own imagined loony bin.

Give me unrelenting displays of cruelty and abuse and subsequent coping mechanisms whose effects are just as vicious as their causes, and sprinkle them with laugh out loud moments clouded by the memories of the aforementioned atrocities. Give me recognition that the brain is an organ just as unwieldy and unreliable as the heart or the kidney, and thinking your way out of something is sometimes the worst possible decision you could ever make. Give me the paragon of masculinity breaking down into snotty sobs in front of an openly weeping crowd of fellow human beings, in a system that cannot possibly work until it does. Give me the revival of hope in mankind, embodied in the briefest touch between one masquerading as the dregs of society, and one unaware of their hopeless plight to a heartrending degree. Give me miscommunication on a truly horrendous scale, conversers following their own narratives with minuscule attention paid to their conversees, many pairs of these circling in a room with no clear and singular \\\"plot\\\". Give me an apocalyptic attempt at righting this miscommunication.

It has no place here. In 1863 Abraham Lincoln decided that the fourth Thursday of each November would be recognized nationally as Thanksgiving. Today happens to be the fourth Thursday in November. Happy Thanksgiving.|I would like to give thanks to the fact that I finished this mother-effing book today.|It's now 9:40 EST as I start to write this review. I finished reading approximately five hours ago. Since then I have polished off almost an entire bottle of Chardonnay. It's taken me this long to a) get a nice enough buzz on, and b) have any desire to update my review to this book. My desire to review this book is equal to the desire I had to |read| this book - both seem like a really good idea, but in the process of either I sort of feel like I'd probably be better off wrangling a squirrel with my bare hands. But, okay, to be fair, there were times while I read this that I really enjoyed it. My wrists never actually enjoyed holding the book, but my mind was amused once in a while at the mental gymnastics which were required to get through some of the passages. Other times my mind told my eyeballs they were really effing dumb to keep looking at the page. Those were the times in which the book was set off to the side and wasn't picked up again for sometimes weeks at a time. It sat next my bed for the most part. I hated this book during those times. It was there when I went to sleep at night and it was there when I woke up in the morning. It might as well have had eyes because I felt it constantly looking at me. I think one morning it even handed me my glasses.|Infinite Jest became a third roommate. One that wasn't even paying rent, but it gives okay head so I kept it around.|I read 37 other books in the time that I spent also reading Infinite Jest. Another GR friend read only 24 other books during her reading of this book. No, I'm not judging myself. Okay, maybe I am a little bit. Excuse me, I need another glass of wine.|I know, I know. This whole review is completely unstable. Why rate a book so high if the review itself sounds so low? I never take almost four months to read a book that I love, so that fact alone must mean I really hated this, right?|Oh, if only it were that easy.|I don't love Infinite Jest. I think a part of me hates it. Actually, a large part of me hates it. I hate that it took me almost four months to read it, and I hate that it consumed so much of my time and energy. I hate that I so very much wanted to know how it ended, preventing me from abandoning it entirely. I hate that there were so many endnotes, and sometimes those footnotes went on for a really long time and may as well have been whole chapters in and of themselves. The different story lines? Hated them. I can't tell you how many times I swore at the book, how many times I swore at the memory of David Foster Wallace himself for writing such a book, how many times I argued with myself, \\\"Summabitch, this is like postmodernist fiction - no, it's |worse| than postmodern literature... this is like... |post|-postmodern literature...\\\" At times I thought that maybe I should give |Ulysses| another read because in comparison it's like reading those Dick and Jane books. (BTW, reading Joyce is nothing like reading Dick and Jane books, and Infinite Jest is really no more difficult than reading Ulysses. I'm just waxing hyperbolic here.)|But there were some really incredible aspects to Infinite Jest, and I would be wrong not to give some shout-outs to those things as well. The story lines that I hated? I also sort of loved them. There's really no good way of giving the story line any sort of true justice here. There's a reason the book is over a thousand pages - you're crazy if you think I'm going to even try to sum it up here. Don't be lazy, read it yourself. Anyway, I loved the stories, which only makes me hate the book even more. Hi, I'm a woman, get over it.|Incidentally, at the same time I've been reading this I've also been reading some crazy modern French philosophy dudes, and secretly I've been making comparisons between the two books. Which is why when I reached this passage (highly edited to hurry along my point for this purpose, bold fonts are mine for emphasis) on page 792 I sort of vomited a little in my mouth before screaming and passing out a bit:| |...the entire perfect-entertainment-as-| Liebestod| myth surrounding the purportedly lethal final cartridge was nothing more than a classic illustration of the antinomically |schizoid| function of the post-industrial |capitalist| mechanism, whose logic presented commodity as the escape-from-anxieties-of-mortality-which-escape-is-itself-psychologically-fatal, as detailed in perspicuous detail in |M. Gilles Deleuze's| posthumous |Incest and the Life of Death in Capitalist Entertainment...|On page 838-9:| |To concoct something the gifted boy couldn't simply master and move on from to a new |plateau|.| |In case you were wondering, the other book I am reading at this time is |A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia| by Deleuze and his buddy, Guattari. Hello! Coincidence!? That's pretty crazy. That requires another glass of wine to process.|Seriously, Deleuze and Guattari are written all over this Wallace guy. I know very little about Wallace. I know he wrote books like Infinite Jest, had a rough life, died way too young at his own hand, and... well, that's pretty much it. I haven't read anything else by him, though I might. The point is I don't know how much he was into those crazy Frenchies, but I would say he had to have read them, studied them, or maybe, like myself, was a part of a really pretentious book club in which they spend almost five hours dissecting three chapters of A Thousand Plateaus at a time. The thought actually made me feel a little closer to Wallace.|But then I remembered how angry I've been at Deleuze and Guattari as well over the past few months and decided they're all back on the bus. (The Bus, btw, is just a pretend bus inside my head where I imagine putting people that I don't like onto said bus and then eventually driving them all off a cliff. A really high cliff.)|At the same time, it's genius. Wallace was genius for writing this book, a non-traditional dystopia which, I might add, also sort of gets me all hot and bothered because I do like a well-written dystopia. He was genius for making all these connections to things like Deleuze and Guattari, things that a lot of people don't really read; it made me wonder what other references he made that I'm not familiar with and therefore I missed completely. I was happy to at least catch that one.|It seems this is the sort of book that people either love or hate - there's very little middle-ground on this one. It seems people read this more than once, though for the life of me I can't imagine ever wanting to read it again. I'm glad I read it once, for sure. And when I say \\\"glad\\\" I mean it in the same way that I mean it when I say I'm \\\"glad\\\" my mom made me eat really nasty vegetables when I was a kid. I didn't like them but they were good for me. That's sort of what Infinite Jest is. A giant, thousand-+-page vegetable that you know is good for you but it doesn't really taste that great, and putting ketchup on it doesn't help. I'm just a healthier reader because I was able to stomach it.|But it didn't change my life. I refuse to say that it did. It will, however, stick with me. And there again is that stupid genius of Wallace. He wrote a big spanking book that manages to really stick with a reader. But, like I ask constantly, especially when it comes to Deleuze and Guattari - |was it necessary??|I sort of feel like that Rip Van Winkle guy in that |Washington Irving| story. Like I've been asleep for a really long time (in this case, it's been since August 2nd when I started reading Infinite Jest) and now I'm awake and holy crap, things have changed with the rest of the world. I would read Infinite Jest before going to bed at night, and then wake up suddenly only to realize I had been |dreaming| about reading Infinite Jest. There was no break between putting the book down, turning off the light and falling asleep. It all just continued in my head. And it seems this is the kind of book that people remember |where| they were while they were reading this more than they can actually remember what it's about. I remember where I was when I heard Kurt Cobain had died. I remember where I was in my life while I was reading Infinite Jest. The finer details of my life are actually a little blurry during this reading though because it consumes so much energy to read it that it sort of overshadows everything else.|So that was my Thanksgiving. I knew part of my plan for the day was to get totally trashed on wine and finish Infinite Jest, which is mostly why I didn't invite my brother over to celebrate the day with us. (Sorry bro!) Now I've been sitting here giving two big middle fingers to the copy of Infinite Jest beside me. Eventually maybe we'll make up, but for now it's time for bed because, alas, I have to work in the morning and I have to sleep this Wallace-Jest-Chardonnay-buzz off. If you read all the way down to this sentence then you're awesome and you are probably worthy and capable of reading Infinite Jest on your own. I wish you well. Tip: Read all of the endnotes. **Note: This review was written almost 10 years ago. I would gladly delete it, but it appears some people have engaged in fruitful back-and-forth in the comment thread. I let it stand for the sake of their discussion, but since every once in a while I wake up to an email informing me of how some stranger on the internet thinks I'm an asshole (and as I'm also a person who can't stand the heat and would gladly get out of the kitchen if I could), I'd like to add a few disclaimers.|This review was written by a young woman who never dreamed more than 2 or 3 people would read it. Hence, I was not attempting to be Northrop Frye. I was being silly. I entirely agree the review would be better if it attempted real, concrete criticism rather than aggressive shrugging. To write that review, though, I would have to really care about Infinite Jest, and I just don't. God knows I've tried, but I don't. |That doesn't mean I think DFW had nothing to say. He certainly did, and I'm sympathetic to lots of it. But postmodernism is not my genre. I have no patience with it.|Finally, this review was the product of an incarnate, imperfect person with background associations and moods trickling into their work. I had a chip on my shoulder when I wrote this and my AHWOSG review; you could say I was sneering at someone(s) in the review because I hadn't the guts to do so face-to-face (of course, sneering is bad and one shouldn't do it on the internet or face-to-face). As I wrote above, a good and meaningful review would be far more impartial, specific, and clear. But this isn't a good and meaningful review. It's a hasty sneer with perhaps some basis for its attitude but certainly not in the review as written, and the author would gladly delete it save for the fact that it hosts a comment thread other people find productive.|So enjoy discussing the works of DFW with my blessing, but if you are awaiting a response from me on the merits of the book or to further explode in fireworks of snark, I'm afraid you'll be waiting in vain. The thread stays; please, be polite to one another. Even if snark has some ground in the truth, it only encourages snark in others, and no one feels good or changes their mind when they feel attacked.** |END NOTE, ORIGINAL REVIEW BEGINS|Infinite Jest is a symptom of something wrong in the literary world: is there nothing else out there with meaning people can find to adore? It's neither a work of genius, nor is it insightful. There are serious things wrong with this book. I think the bigger problem here is why anyone, anywhere, thinks this is brilliant. Somehow the advent of smarmy advertisement and sterile, banal corporate living over the past one hundred and fifty years has invaded our literature, and we think it's wonderful and genius and metaphorical... why? Because it is self-referential, because it's mocking us on a deep level? I thought good literature was something people could access (or at least should be able to), that ideas should be understandable, and should have real content. As many a wiser human being has pointed out, if it's not even mildly coherent, it's probably bogus. Critics rave about this novel for many reasons, one of which I suppose is so they don't have to talk about the concrete and tremendous problems we are actually facing... God forbid literature should be anything more than a ridiculous competition between whose work is the most ground-breaking and incoherent. It shouldn't be a surprise, I guess, but it's depressing anyway. It was only a matter of time before our publishing companies started thinking something like this was a good idea. |(*second note: since i wrote this review i've found myself looking at other works of foster wallace and thinking these may actually be interesting. my dislike of this particular novel is not meant to be an attack on the author, or any of the people who love it. but i'll let my over-the-top comments stand, and acknowledge here that yes, they are a bit much) I have written a more substantial but no more real review than the little blurb that used to sit here. The original blurb written on the day I heard DFW died follows this lengthy and self-indulgent exercise.|Within a year of each other two works of entertainment were released that have been pretty darn influential to me. One is this book, and the other was Jawbreaker's album |Dear You|. Both are relatively polarizing works, people either seem to love it or hate it*. |Jawbreaker's album was a momentous failure. It alienated just about everyone who had any expectations for the band. Their penultimate album, |24 Hour Revenge Therapy| had been vehemently anti-corporate. For a time, Jawbreaker were seen as the poster-children for DIY punk second only to Fugazi. They were producing great music and doing it on their own terms. After the release of |24 Hour Revenge Therapy| Jawbreaker would open for Nirvana on the |In Utero| tour. Accusations of sell-out flew, and people began looking at the band with the beady little suspicious eyes that the punk world loves peering at the world through. Rumors started flying that in no time the band would be signed to DGC the label that Nirvana was on, that this was the first step to their own rockstardom, and of course the chorus of sell-out grew louder. One defender of the band, Ben Weasel who still hasn't been excommunicated from |Maximum RocknRoll| for the heretical charges of allowing a song of his to appear on a major label produced soundtrack stood by the band and wrote in his column that he'd eat his hat if Jawbreaker signed to a major label. He ended up eating the hat. The band signed to DGC and released their most polished album. The album was a spectacular flop. The punk world turned their collective back on the band and the mainstream world didn't give a shit. It didn't help that the video and single the band released was for one of the two weakest songs on the album. The band ended up succumbing lackluster sales, criticism and infighting. Eventually one member of the band spat gum at another in the middle of an argument and that spat gum ended the band (I'm only adding this fact to show the evils of gum. Bad Blake!).|I'm slowly going somewhere with all of this. If Jawbreaker had released | this | song instead of \\\"Fireman\\\" I think they would have been huge. It would have been the anthem that songs like \\\"Smells like Teen Spirit\\\" and \\\"Cherub Rock\\\" were. The reason for all of this preamble is to share these couple of lines that come towards the end of \\\"Save Your Generation\\\":|You have to learn|to learn from your mistakes.|You can afford|to lose a little face.|The things you break,|some can't be replaced.|A simple rule:|every day be sure you wake.|One of the things DFW liked to point out in interviews is that we are bombarded with a massive amount of information and part of our goal is to make sense of all that information. The problem isn't how to absorb all of the information, because that is an impossible feat, it's how to choose what information we choose to filter in and out of our consciousness and what we choose to do with that information. I'm not talking about what kind of use value we can take from the information bombarding us, what the pragmatic value of the information is. That is an easy way to solve the problem, but it's not necessarily an option for everyone. It also leads to an alienation and objectification of the entire world. Everything is turned into a tool. This is a fine way to live, many people do it. Some people can't do this though, people who see the world in this way would never like this book, but that's ok because they probably will one day own really nice things. Another way out of the problem is to bombard oneself with something so endlessly diverting that no other information is necessary. Both solutions are putting tremendous limits on the uptake of information, and either deliberately or unconsciously limiting the world around us into super-easily manageable nuggets. At the other extreme is to be affected by everything and be so overwhelmed by the world that everything becomes white noise. Unfiltered receptions. Instead there has to be some kind of middle ground. And one could add, the middle ground needs to be made with awareness. One needs to remind oneself to wake up everyday.|I'd suggest that the structure of the book is designed to make the reader conscious of not necessarily the fact that s/he is reading a book, but to think about what the reader is reading. An easier book could be read in the way that the boys at the tennis academy squeeze the tennis balls constantly. There is no thought to the exercise. They are developing exaggerated muscles but it is through a mindlessness and it is a very localized improvement. One of my favorite passages (of which there are many) is the second person (ok, I could be wrong about this, maybe it's not in the second person, my memory of it is, but my memory is also very fallible) description of what it takes to succeed at tennis. The pain and repetition involved. The filtering out of everything aside from the focus at succeeding. Someone in this position reduces the world to a very manageable number of bytes a day, the success at tennis bytes. Just like the obsessive pothead reduces the world to a very manageable, things I need to do to smoke a shit ton of pot this weekend bytes. Just like the person watching The Entertainment reduces everything to the this is fucking entertaining (whatever It is) bytes.|This book is massive and overwhelming. It's a total onslaught of information. And the information is presented in a jarring manner. There is the non-sequential order of the narrative, there is the long sentences, the difficult language and of course the endnotes. A lot is put in front of the reader, there are a lot of characters to keep track of, thinking about when a scene is taking place in relation to other scenes in the books and this is made even more difficult by the use of corporate names to designate years. It's information overload. |And then the information the reader is presented with is hammered with the details DFW chooses to give. As expansive as the novel is it is also incredibly claustrophobic at times in it's interiority. |This novel isn't for everyone. I'd never recommend it to someone. I'm fairly certain I've never recommended it to anyone**. I think it takes a particular type of person to enjoy this book, and I think that this type of person is defined by how they experience the world and by what goes on in their head. Most importantly by what happens inside a person's head. I'm probably just projecting here, and I know that there are other types of people than myself that love this book too, but I don't think it's necessarily a happy and healthy person who is the type that this book is written for. I don't think happy and healthy people experience or want to slog through a barrage of reflexiveness. I'm not putting into words really what I'm thinking here. I'm missing the words right now. But this comes back to my ongoing repetition of the question why does one read?|For me, reading is work. Rarely, do I read for pure enjoyment, or to just kill some time or to escape. I don't find reading a sort of punishment and I enjoy it more than I enjoy anything else in this stupid world. I think of reading as an active activity, it's not something to narcotize to, and maybe that is a reason why I am baffled whenever I hear that someone reads when they are drunk or fucked up in someway. For me, being in a state like that would be to be too unaware. It might be really pathetic but my real experience with the world I live in is through books, they are frankly more interesting than most people, and the inner conversations and thoughts I have with the books I read are much more interesting than the ones I have with other flesh and blood people. This is my own failing, I'm a generally uninteresting person to talk to, I don't hold up my own weight in conversations, I stammer and I mispronounce words that I can hear correctly in my head but which my tongue wants nothing to do with, I pull verbal punches, my shitty hearing does a shitty job at making sense of everything other people say, my sentences stop abruptly mid-way through a thought as if I expect that whomever is talking to me will be able to fill in the gaps, I fail to say what I'm thinking and end up feeling like an idiot when I speak***. In a way of thinking reading is escapism for me, but it's an escape from the difficulties of dealing with real live people and having the kinds of dialogs I'll rarely have in real life (with maybe the exception of some of these reviews, but those aren't dialogs, those are rants and one-sided diatribes, but where the idea of votes are important not because I want to be popular but because they are the only way to know if some other person (possibly, it's always a possibility that all the votes are just clicked on without anyone having read a word of the review)) has read them, that the thoughts have been heard by another. |To leave my self-deprecating blabbering aside, or to use it for uses of good instead of just wallowing, it's partially because of the reasons I read that I find |Infinite Jest| to be so fucking good. It's a thousand plus pages of small details, of forcing myself to be even more aware than I usually am when reading, it's unanswered questions and openness in the text and clues. It's a self-contained world that can be read without having to bring any of the outside world necessarily into it (yes it helps to have say |Hamlet| in the back of your mind when reading certain scenes, but I was a shitty student in my English classes in High School so I totally missed the glaring Shakespeare reference in the title, or in Hal's name or in the graveyard scene. Facts like this just add some more richness to the book, but it's not necessary knowledge to enjoying the book), everything you need for the book is inside it. Unlike say |Ulysses| you don't need to have a firm background in Irish History to know what the hell is even going some of the time, everything and more is constructed and presented to the reader. Presented might be the wrong word. Presented makes it sound like everything is handed to the reader on a silver platter, which it's not, everything needed for the book is given to the reader but the reader has to meet the book at least half-way in putting it all together. |We, as a society, don't generally like things that put a demand on us to do that much of the work. There is no reason that anyone should feel they have to do that kind of work |just| to read a book. Even for the literary minded there is no reason that one should feel like they have to do that kind of work. It's a matter of wanting to read books that demand something of the reader of wanting to read something that demands our attention. There are plenty of excellent books out there that don't put these kinds of demand on us. Even personally I don't always want to be put through the rigmarole that a writer like DFW is asking for. Probably, almost every book of literature can be read with the demands that DFW is asking of the reader, but not every book is explicitly asking the reader to do so. Like, I'm sure |The Corrections| can be read really actively and a bunch of things can be pulled out of the text that a casual perusal of the book would miss, but it's also a book that can be read relatively passively. It's not a book asking much from us. |As a society, we like things to be given to us already in their manageably sized bytes. |In my parents downstairs, 'guest', bathroom there is a framed advertisement from the early 1960's for some Volvo (ignore the fact that there is a picture of a car in the bathroom for a moment). This ad isn't necessarily remarkable in anyway, but it is standing in for any advertisement from that era. The thing about the advertisement that stands out is the wordiness, there are |paragraphs!!!| of text to get the point across about the high level of safety concerns about Sweden and how those carry over into their automobiles. |Paragraphs!!!|. The advertisement takes a little bit of time to read. This is unheard of now. This advertisement is demanding a very low level of work from the viewer but still much more work to get to the message it's trying to convey than a modern ad in a magazine. |As a society, we like things to be given to us in very manageably sized bytes. Just think of the theory behind Twitter marketing where information is given to us in tiny little tweets****. When there is so much already half-digested bits of information already floating around just waiting for our retinas to pass over them and absorb the message without even having to break our stride why would someone stop to tackle something difficult and that demands we help out in the conveying of the information? | |Infinite Jest| is not a pragmatic book. It's not going to make you a better person for reading it. It won't answer life's questions, and it will possibly leave you with more questions coming out of it than going in. It's not an easy and light fun read. It probably wouldn't be the book you want to bring on the beach. It's tough to read on the subway and it's heavy so traveling with it can be a problem. You can't even easily say what the book is about when a curious person asks you \\\"Whatcha reading?\\\" |I'm going to wrap up this failure of a review. I wanted to write a positive review of |Infinite Jest|, I had actually been challenged to write a review of why I loved the book but I don't think I did that. I don't know exactly what this review is, maybe a long rambling something or other about the importance of paying attention to the world around you, to look at the details, to try to remember to wake up everyday even though it is easier to sleep off five year chunks at a time, and that there are loads of ways to do this seemingly simple task and in a way this book is a giant exercise in telling us to be more aware, to engage, to see the details even if sometimes the details just are the what the chemical compounds are in some commonly taken drug, it's the act of having to see there is something more than the commonly known, easily overlooked and empty-ish words to the world around us. And sometimes what we find there isn't that important but it's the act that is, not the guaranteed pragmatic results.|*In the case of Jawbreaker the love/hate relationship is generally only seen in the bands fans. In the case of DFW his fans generally love |Infinite Jest| and it is other works that are held in different opinions. While I acknowledge someone can be a big DFW fan and only like his non-fiction I personally think an enjoyment of |Infinite Jest| is essential to saying you like DFW. |**I could easily be wrong about this fact though.|*** FYI, I'm not fishing for compliments or for someone to say, no you aren't like that at all. |**** I was under the idea that a tweet was 256 characters of less, but I'm sure everyone knows that it is actually 140 characters or less. I was going to make a point about this being the reduction of manageable bytes down to one byte, where a byte is made up of 8 bits, and in the binary system this leads to there being 256 permutations of ones and zeros in a byte. Based on this metaphor though the manageable number of bytes in a tweet is less than a byte. |-------------------------------------|This is my original 'review'|I just read a comment on the LA Times story about his suicide, and it said, \\\"the world's a shittier place now.\\\" I couldn't agree more. One of our true geniuses kills himself and some asshole douche bag like James Patterson or Nora Roberts will continue pumping out three or four novels a year. Fuck. The world is a shittier place.  Goodness, this is a polarizing piece of work. |I started IJ with much anticipation and high expectations, fueled by the praises of many, many, people I know and respect. I\\u2019m thrilled that so many enjoy IJ \\u2013 what\\u2019s better than a book that makes you squeal with joy? Not much.|Obviously I didn\\u2019t click with IJ. Or with Wallace\\u2019s writing style. Or both. |It just was not for me.|For the first 100-200 pages or so I believed I was going to enjoy this much more than I did. The set up was intriguing. The topics really spoke to me and the characters were promising. But as I read on and the pages wore on, I began to lose interest and worse, every time a character or scene would capture me it was either too fleeting or it talked itself out of being interesting by dragging on for three or four times longer than it should have been.|It became a chore to read.|I am a character over plot person any day of the week. Easily. And my biggest frustration (yes, even more than the footnotes. Yes, even more than the overwriting), was the lack of character development. Wallace had some very creative character bios but they never blossomed into anything more than sterile, soulless beings. None of them felt real and none of them got into my gut like those unforgettable characters inevitably do. And as such I was not granted entry into their heads, which is one of my favorite things about a really great book. The ability to not be merely a fly on the wall, but to be inside the anxiety and the hurt and the uncertainty of the people I\\u2019m reading about.|Perhaps this was Wallace\\u2019s intention. I hope it was and if so he succeeded. |Another point of contention was that every now and then a character would emerge that would strike a chord with me only to disappear without a trace. One example was Kate Gompert who appears at around p.100 with a beautifully pained portrait of debilitating depression. I spent the rest of the book wanting more of her and others like her and when I finally got them back their stories never materialized to very much. I didn\\u2019t feel as endeared with Hal or Orin or Steeply, for instance, as I did with these background extras. |Again, maybe this was the point. Have you ever had a single conversation with somebody, never seen them again, yet can remember them vividly years later? Have you ever met someone who struck you on some level but was unattainable? People come, people go. |But I wanted more.|It wasn\\u2019t all bad. No, no. Buried deep within the prose there were some pretty funny scenes. Not hilarious. Not clutch your belly \\u2018cause it hurts. Not remember \\u2018til the day I die. But amusing, sure. And Wallace\\u2019s wisdom about the human condition and how much it hurts was captivating and true. |IJ has some interesting ideas and compelling themes. Alas, I felt they were almost always overshadowed by sloppy writing. Scenes that could\\u2019ve been extremely poignant lost their impact when stretched to 20-30 pages.

I mention this because the first time I saw M.D., I immediately rewatched it. Likewise for I.J. - as soon as I finished it, I flipped to the beginning and started again. This is a book so fractured in structure that it needs serious re-examination and puzzling over. M.D. and I.J. break up the story rather than direct telling, dropping clues and hints along the way. They both are confusing and strange, and sometimes deeply chilling, but heartbreaking sadness is the ultimate effect. |Big Important Books (B.I.B.) always have many resources available to help us sort things out.

But you\\u2019d be forgiven for being duped by the verisimilitude with which DFW depicts those who suffer from being rudderless, in their myriad efforts of self effacement, through means chemical and consumerist. This is a truly unique book, by a brilliant and tortured mind, and if you give it a chance, it will seduce you away from the comforts of traditional narrative structures and show you something unforgettable. So, so far....|I know what I weigh. I brush my teeth, paint my toes, wash my hair. I dress up my tote of skin as best I can. I do all this, spend all this time on my outside because I care about what other people think and see and smell and hear about me. But the real me, the unique substance that resides inside my skin and bones and fluids, that many call a soul, doesn\\u2019t get the same treatment. And it should. It really should.|It is so much more important than my freckled flesh. But I don\\u2019t know what my soul weighs. I\\u2019m not as attentive to its image. But if it covered me, if it was the first thing someone saw when they met me, perhaps I would pay more attention to it and less to my physical being. And a part of me trembles to think of what would happen if, instead of placing a best foot forward, it was requirement that a side of your soul took a promenade. What would the watermark of myself look like? It worries me what would be on display. I have rotten spots, neglected areas. Dark desires. Places where I\\u2019ve stuffed bad memories, hoping that no one, not even myself, would ever remember them. |And maybe I\\u2019m wrong, maybe not everyone is scared of living in their soul\\u2019s shadow. Perhaps this|isn\\u2019t an everyman type of problem; it\\u2019s a me-because-I\\u2019m-fucked-up-problem, and it is an indicator|of how bad off I am that I imagine that everyone feels this way. |And then in walks David Foster Wallace and I start to think that maybe if not everyone worries |\\u201cAm I fucked up, and if so, how bad?\\u201d certainly he or his characters by extension do. And now,|Thanks to DFW, I have also started theorizing instead that if people don\\u2019t ask themselves how fucked up they|are then they are really and truly fucked.  the world of ideas as they blow through the buttons of our coats, through the letters in our rooms, through the flowers in our tombs, blowing every time we move our teeth.   It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society. |Attributed to Jiddu Krishnamurti, this quote I believe sums up nicely the experience of reading \\\"Infinite Jest\\\". Among hundreds of characters trying to cope with a dystopian near future society, I believe there's not a single one that could be called sane or healthy. (Arguably, Mario Incandenza has a beautiful mind inside a severely handicapped body). An impressive gallery of misfits, addicts, loners and clinically depressive people are offered to the reader in lieu of Entertainment, challenging us to inspect, analyze and eventually redefine our positions in regard to the modern way of life. The words that first come to mind after finishing the novel are 'monumental' and 'exhaustive' and deeply, deeply disturbing.| Insane is just like a catch-term, it doesn't describe anything, it isn't a reason for anything. |Is the whole Incandenza family crazy? Are any of the people inside Ennet House balanced and dependable? Am I, the reader, free of addictions and self-deceptions? Or are we all fallible human beings, confused and frightened, lonely and perpetually sad? Is the O.N.A.N.-ite future society a dystopian nightmare or a documentary of the way we live now, something along the lines of that scary \\\"Idiocracy\\\" flick or, even more appropriate, the couch potatoes of the future seen in \\\"WALL-E\\\"? Is the novel truly a post-modern masterpiece or a grandiose, self-indulgent and cynical 'jest' aimed at a pretentious and shallow readership? James Incandenza, the avantgarde director of the novel has numerous examples of pretend entertainments that can be interpreted as both practical jokes and profound psychological essays. One of them is even called \\\"The Joke\\\" and could very well serve as a synposis of this 1000+ page novel:| ... video cameras in the theater record the 'film's audience and project the resultant raster onto screen - the theater audience watching itself watch itself get the obvious 'joke' and become increasingly self-conscious and uncomfortable and hostile supposedly comprises the film's involuted 'antinarrative' flow. |This 'antinarrative' atitude from the author gave me a lot of trouble as a reader more familiar with traditional plot and character developments. But if the intent of the joke is to push me out of my comfort zone and make me reasses my 'certainties' then Wallace's broken, time twisted and hallucinogenic style is eminently effective.|\\\"Infinite Jest\\\" is both story and commentary on the story, with the salient points explored in lengthy internal monologues, art-film critique and philosophical dialogue (such a conversation between two spies on a mountain top in Arizona goes on for several hundred pages). This should make the reviewer's job easier, but to do the novel justice said reviewer would probably need twice the number of pages in the book to make sure he didn't miss any nuance or causal relationship. I have read online that there are universities in the U.S. offering courses in interpretation of David Foster Wallace literary opus, and I can actually see myself signing up and taking such a course, in order to be able to discuss and share my feelings about the people encountered in the novel.|With the limited time at my disposal and with the word count limit here on Goodreads I believe it will be more useful that, instead of an exhaustive study of the novel, I make an attempt to simplify the equations and present them to potential readers in a way that makes this metafictional monster accesible and even desirable.| What if in fact there were ever only two really distinct individual people walking around back there in history's mist? That all difference descends from this difference? The whole and the partial. The damaged and the intact. The deformed and the paralyzingly beautiful. The insane and the attendant. The hidden and the blindingly open. The performer and the audience. No Zen-type One, always rather Two, one upside-down in a convex lens. |Instead of trackind several hundred people we can focus on two : Hal Incandenza and Don Gately. The rest of the cast are just gravitating around these two focus points, offering variations on any given theme or exercising outside influence on the inner mental landscapes of Hal and Don G. Hal is a 16 y.o. prodigy in tennis, with eidetic memory and a passion for grammar and encyclopedias. Don is a twenty-seven y.o. drug addict, burglar and connvict trying to put his life back together in a half-way house, attending daily A.A. meetings. Both of them come from disfunctional families, experiment with mind-altering Substances and have a hard time communicating with their peers.|The opening chapter in the novel is emblematic of the disconnect between the private and the public personality of the hero. Hal Incandenza earnestly tries to reach out and asks to be understood, while the audience shrinks back in horror and throws him directly into the loony ward.| I am not just a boy who plays tennis. I have an intricate history. Experiences and feelings. I'm complex. I read. I study and read. I bet I've read everything you've read. Don't think I haven't. I consume libraries. I wear out spines and ROM-drives. I do things like get in a taxi and say, \\\"The library, and step on it.\\\" [...] I'm not a machine. I feel and believe. I have opinions. Some of them are interesting. I could, if you'd let me, talk and talk. Let's talk about anything. |The rest of the novel is actually this attempt of Hal / Wallace to talk about anything under the sun. Professional sports, drugs and addiction, movie making, terrorism, pollution, atomic energy, game theory, geopolitics, self-help groups, inner city violence, family disintegration, mental illness, physical deformity, sexuality, radio programs, art criticism, conspiracy theories, consummerism, grammar, probability theories, nuclear warfare, astral projection, suicide, etc. I promised I will make it simple, so I will put all these eggs in one basket named :  Entertainment . I believe the reduction is made possible by two observations from Wallace : addiction is not only about drugs, and everything we do is motivated by trying to get release from loneliness. Entertainment is the way we either seek self-escaping (oblivion) or self-confronting (knowledge and redemption). | It now lately sometimes seemed like a kind of black miracle to me that people could actually care deeply about a subject or a pursuit, and could go on caring this way for years on end. Could dedicate their entire lives to it. It seemed admirable and at the same time pathetic. We are all dying to givew our lives away to something, maybe. God or Satan, politics or grammar, topology or philately - the object seemed incidental to this will to give oneself away, utterly. To games or needles, to some other person. Something pathetic about it. A flight-from in the form of a plunging-into. |Entertainment as an addiction is the engine of the plot, as much as we can talk about plot in this antinarrative novel. Hal's father James is both the founder of the Enfield Tennis Academy where his son studies and where most of the action of the novel takes place, and the pioneer optical wizard and experimental film maker who tried (and apparently succeeded) in making the perfect Entertainment : a movie so addictive it turns its viewers into closed chapters / drooling, catatonic, empty shells.| The choice for death of the head by pleasure now exists. |and,| A device for extending O.N.A.N.'s self-destructing logic to its final conclusion |U.S. (allied with Canada and Mexico to become the Organization of North American Nations in the novel, a transparent reference to onanism) secret agents and Quebec terrorists both try to get their hands on the master copy of this movie, apparently titled \\\"The Joke\\\", by studying the Incandenza family history. A history marked by at least three generations of parent to child traumatic experiences, betrayals, adictions and phobias that culminate in the auteur's (James) gruesome suicide immediately after the production of this ultimate movie. I think I have at least four possible solutions to the puzzle of the Final Solution film, and the genius of Wallace is that probably every reader will discover a couple more than me, once he or she starts to ponder on their own addictions and phobias. (for example what I call hobbies my friends might call trivial pursuits; in my case it applies to reading, eating, watching five movies in one day, rock collection, computer games, etc). In James Incandenza's case, an unsympathetic critic might remark on his self-absorbtion, another reference to onanism:| Joelle thought them more like a very smart person conversing with himself. |a socialite / academic professor trying to impress her peers with her erudition and coolness :| ... there was little question that the entire perfect-entertainment-as-Liebestod myth surrounding the purportedly lethal final cartridge was nothing more than a classic illustration of the antinomically schizoid function of the post-industrial capitalist mechanism, whose logic presented commodity as the escape-from-anxieties-of-mortality-which-escape-is-itself-psychologically-fatal ... |For the students of Shakespeare, and the often mentioned reference to Hamlet from the title, a monologue on Death as the ultimate motivator, taken from another of the auteur's movies:| We thus become, in the absence of death as teleologic end, ourselves desiccated, deprived of some essential fluid, aridly cerebral, abstract, conceptual, little more than hallucinations of God. |For Himself, as James is called by his children, the movie is a final attempt to break the vicious circle of transferring the sins of the fathers onto the next generation:| Make something so bloody compelling it would reverse thrust on a young self's fall into the womb of solypsism, anhedonia, death in life. A magically entertaining toy to dangle at the infant still somewhere alive in the boy, to make its eyes light and toothless mouth open unconsciously, to laugh. To bring him 'out of himself', as they say. The scholars and Foundations and disseminators never saw that his most serious wish was : to entertain. |>><<>><<>><<>><<|With the last quote I believe I can make the transition to anoter of my pet theories - that the novel is not so much autobiographical as self-referencing. James and Hal Incandenza, even Orin in his compulsive pursuit of sex, Don Gately, Kate Gompert and the other addicts trying to work their way through A.A., all of them are alter egos of the author, who used the form of entertainment (a novel) as an attempt to exorcise his personal demons his decades long fight with clinical depression. The encyclopedic nature of the study of mental illness, addiction recovery programs, suicide and communication breakdown points to the author's own struggle and ultimate defeat in this infinite battle against oblivion.| Sarcasm and jokes were often the bottle in which clinical depressives sent out their most plangent screams for someone to care and help them. | ( Katherine Ann Gompert)|and,| | It's not desiring the fall; it's terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling 'Don't!' and 'Hang on!', can understand the jump. Not really. You'd have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling. |  (on suicide)|and,| \\\"Ramy, I don't think I'm like thinking this is a feel-better story at all\\\" | (Kate Gompert)|and,| | 'I could use a quality laugh right now, Dark.' | | (Hal Incandenza)|and,| 'Help! I'm screaming for help and everybody's acting as if I'm singing Ethel Merman covers! It's me, screaming for help!' | (Hal, again)|and, finally:| 'Touch me, just touch me, please!' | (Barry Loach, outside a Boston metro exit)|>><<>><<>><<| | Ahh, look at all the lonely people,| Where do they all come from? | |Here comes Erdedy in the second chapter of the novel, sitting alone in his apartment, waiting for his drug dealer to bring him a bag of pot, right out of an alternate version of the Beatles song. Even his name reminds one of Eleanor Rigby:| He thought very broadly of desires and ideas being watched but not acted upon, he thought of impulses being starved of expression and drying out and floating dryly away. |Erdedy is just the first (if you don't count Hal in the first chapter) in a long list of sad, lonely people that populate the pages of Wallace's masterpiece. The big question here is : are we born sad, dying little by little with every breath we take? or are we lost somewhere along the way, discarded like broken toys by the well-adapted, 'normal' people? How do we get infected with what Orin Incandenza describes in one place as a \\\"a kind of peritonitis of the soul\\\"? Look at Orin, in his top athletic form, the best punter in American football, young and rich and admired, wandering alone in his penthouse apartment, gazing at the desolate landscape of Arizona:| These worst mornings with cold floors and hot windows and merciless light - the soul's certainty that the day will have to be not traversed but sort of climbed, vertically, and then that going to sleep again at the end of it will be like falling, again, off something tall and sheer. |Look at his brother Hal, 16 y.o. and already a secret pot smoker:| It occured to me that without some one-hitters to be able to look forward to smoking alone in the tunnel I was waking up every day feeling as though there was nothing in the day to anticipate or lend anything any meaning. |Basically, the attack comes from four directions : (1) family (Joelle notes that the Incandenzas were the second saddest family she has ever known) , (2)school, (3) marketing creating fake desires and (4) the job market, or \\\"The Show\\\" as the tennis students refer to their future careers. I could go on and on here recounting the heart breaking stories of wrecked homes and abusive parents, and the hundreds of drugs referenced in the text, but one quote should suffice for now:| Hal himself hasn't had a bona fide intensity-of-interior-life-type emotion since he was tiny; he finds terms like joie and value to be like so many variables in rarified equations, and he can manipulate them well enough to satisfy everyone but himself that he's in there, inside his own skull, as a human being - but in fact he's more robotic than John Wayne. One of his troubles with his Moms is the fact that Avril Incandenza believes she knows him inside and out as a human being, and an internally worthy one at that, when in fact inside Hal there's pretty much nothing at all, he knows. His Moms Avril hears her own echoes inside him and thinks what she hears is him, and this makes Hal feel the one thing he feels to the limit, lately: he is lonely. |Another one has to stand in for all the school bullies that 'helped' us to grow up to the ways of the real world:| M.I.T. students tend to carry their own special psychic scars: nerd, geek, dweeb, wonk, fag, wienie, four-eyes, spazola, limp-dick, needle-dick, dickless, dick-nose, pencil-neck; getting your violin and your laptop TP or entomologist's kill-jar broken over your large head by thick-necked kids on the playground. |also, an explanation on why kids start taking drugs so young:| Recreational drugs are more or less traditional at any U.S. secondary school, maybe because of the unprecedented tensions: post-latency and puberty and angst and impending adulthood, etc. To help manage the intra-psychic storms, etc. |I don't have something witty and insightful about the pressures that come to bear later in life. What I have is a whole alternate review where I started collecting something like flashcards from life in Purgatory:|>>><<<>>><<<>>><<<| If, by the virtue of charity or the circumstance of desperation, you ever chance to spend a little time around a Substance-recovery halfway facility like Enfield MA's state-funded Ennet House, you will acquire many exotic new facts:|- that the chilling Hispanic term for whatever interior disorder drives the addict back again and again to the enslaving Substance is 'tecato gusano', which apparently connotes some kind of interior psychic worm that cannot be sated or killed;|- that over 60% of all persons arrested for drug- and alcohol-related offenses report being sexually abused as children, with two-thirds of the remaining 40% reporting that they cannot remember their childhood in sufficient detail to report one way or the other on abuse.|- that certain persons simply will not like you no matter what you do.
