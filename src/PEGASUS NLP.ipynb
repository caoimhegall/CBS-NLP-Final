Just FYI). |(Review below from October 2014)|I wanted to savour every word in this novel. I alternately dragged out the reading experience to relish the language, and sped through sections because I felt greedy and impatient and wanted to see what linguistic marvels Alan Hollinghurst could produce next.|The story is centered round an upper-middle class family in London, whose son of the house, Toby, has a friend, Nick, stay over at the family\\u2019s posh Kensington home - a situation that lasts longer than any of them had expected and which has consequences for all. During this same period, Nick can no longer ignore his own homosexuality and begins a guilt-ridden yet thrilling exploration of it. As in The Swimming Pool Library and the Stranger\\u2019s Child, there isn\\u2019t (in my view) much plot in The Line of Beauty. It is largely composed of scenes and situations, a satire of rich people and politicians as experienced by the protagonist Nick Guest, who indeed feels like a guest in the privileged lives he witnesses but never quite belongs to. |The novel paints a picture of the 1980s and of Thatcher\\u2019s Britain as seen from the perspective of a young man, who can\\u2019t quite find his feet or a sense of purpose in life, and towards the end it also becomes a story about AIDS. That said, the story didn\\u2019t really get underway, or become interesting, to me until almost 300 pages into the book, exactly the opposite of The Stranger\\u2019s Child where I loved the first few hundred pages and then not so much the rest. |Hollinghurst has the uncanny ability to turn even base, human emotions into beautiful, lyrical prose which time and again made me stop and wonder at his incredible skill. But it isn\\u2019t just the words. It is also his insight into human psychology, his knowingness when it comes to human stupidity, triumphs and pretensions, his ability to observe and name every little tic, gesture and hidden meaning which conversations in society are so full of. (Where Zadie Smith captures the characteristics of some of the conversations belonging to London\\u2019s NW, Hollinghurst captures those of the privileged classes, and these parts were amazing \\u2013 a comedy of manners almost).|To me, this is some of the most beautiful English prose in contemporary English literature. And yet, at the same time, there isn\\u2019t a single character that I really invested in. Especially the main character felt rather anemic to me, pathetic even, in his strange insistence on politeness without integrity, which of course sets off the shallowness of some of the other characters but still had the effect that there was no one to root for. I\\u2019m still wondering what the intended effect was exactly. |Perhaps what I love most about his style is how it is the complete antithesis to the much-praised Scandinavian minimalism that I feel surrounded by (living in Denmark), and for that alone I applaud him. Hollinghurst is inspired by writers like Forster and James, whose works were written a hundred years ago or more, and even if I was not exactly bowled over by his story, there were times where I almost wanted to weep at the exquisiteness of his prose, his lines of beauty. (2-3 stars for the story, 5 stars for the language, leaving me a little above 3,5.

(Mother is dead.) Obeying his wishes is her heart's desire. In this she is a complete idiot, because her father is actually a terrible parent. Not only does Austin Ruthyn neglect her, but his will provides that on his death she will go live with his brother Silas, whom Maud has never met, until her majority. Putting the interests of one's child first would dictate that Maud go to live with her middle-aged cousin Monica, who has a lovely house, plenty of money, is fond of Maud, and actually does have her best interests at heart. But Austin is determined to have Maud live with Silas in order to rehabilitate Silas's reputation in the community: Silas was once accused of murdering a guest in his house, wrongly, Austin feels. If everyone sees that Austin has trusted Silas with the well-being of his child, they will stop believing Silas had anything to do with the man's death (which was, in fact, ruled a suicide). If Maud dies before Silas, he inherits the entire Ruthyn estate. What could possibly go wrong?|This novel had one of my now favorite new plot devices, the carriage ride that seemingly goes somewhere but actually goes nowhere. (It goes in an enormous circle, arriving back at its departure point, carriage inhabitants ignorant.) Supposedly Le Fanu got this plot device from something his great uncle Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the playwright, did once.|Someone should do a study of classic novels by male authors with first person female narrators in which the narrators opine about the characteristics of their gender. You get gems like this (Le Fanu via Maud): \\\"So Lady Knollys argued, with feminine energy, and I must confess, with a good deal of the repetition which I have sometimes observed in logicians of my own sex, and she puzzled without satisfying me.\\\" Translation: \\\"We ladies need to STFU, can I get an amen?\\\"|Then there was this 8-comma sentence, probably surpassed only by The New Yorker at some point....|\\\"I remember how, when, after we had got, late at night, into bed, I sat up, shivering with horror, in mine, while honest Mary's tranquil breathing told how soundly she slept.\\\" I know!

Just FYI). |(Review below from October 2014)|I wanted to savour every word in this novel. I alternately dragged out the reading experience to relish the language, and sped through sections because I felt greedy and impatient and wanted to see what linguistic marvels Alan Hollinghurst could produce next.|The story is centered round an upper-middle class family in London, whose son of the house, Toby, has a friend, Nick, stay over at the family\\u2019s posh Kensington home - a situation that lasts longer than any of them had expected and which has consequences for all. During this same period, Nick can no longer ignore his own homosexuality and begins a guilt-ridden yet thrilling exploration of it. As in The Swimming Pool Library and the Stranger\\u2019s Child, there isn\\u2019t (in my view) much plot in The Line of Beauty. It is largely composed of scenes and situations, a satire of rich people and politicians as experienced by the protagonist Nick Guest, who indeed feels like a guest in the privileged lives he witnesses but never quite belongs to. |The novel paints a picture of the 1980s and of Thatcher\\u2019s Britain as seen from the perspective of a young man, who can\\u2019t quite find his feet or a sense of purpose in life, and towards the end it also becomes a story about AIDS. That said, the story didn\\u2019t really get underway, or become interesting, to me until almost 300 pages into the book, exactly the opposite of The Stranger\\u2019s Child where I loved the first few hundred pages and then not so much the rest. |Hollinghurst has the uncanny ability to turn even base, human emotions into beautiful, lyrical prose which time and again made me stop and wonder at his incredible skill. But it isn\\u2019t just the words. It is also his insight into human psychology, his knowingness when it comes to human stupidity, triumphs and pretensions, his ability to observe and name every little tic, gesture and hidden meaning which conversations in society are so full of. (Where Zadie Smith captures the characteristics of some of the conversations belonging to London\\u2019s NW, Hollinghurst captures those of the privileged classes, and these parts were amazing \\u2013 a comedy of manners almost).|To me, this is some of the most beautiful English prose in contemporary English literature. And yet, at the same time, there isn\\u2019t a single character that I really invested in. Especially the main character felt rather anemic to me, pathetic even, in his strange insistence on politeness without integrity, which of course sets off the shallowness of some of the other characters but still had the effect that there was no one to root for. I\\u2019m still wondering what the intended effect was exactly. |Perhaps what I love most about his style is how it is the complete antithesis to the much-praised Scandinavian minimalism that I feel surrounded by (living in Denmark), and for that alone I applaud him. Hollinghurst is inspired by writers like Forster and James, whose works were written a hundred years ago or more, and even if I was not exactly bowled over by his story, there were times where I almost wanted to weep at the exquisiteness of his prose, his lines of beauty. (2-3 stars for the story, 5 stars for the language, leaving me a little above 3,5.

(Mother is dead.) Obeying his wishes is her heart's desire. In this she is a complete idiot, because her father is actually a terrible parent. Not only does Austin Ruthyn neglect her, but his will provides that on his death she will go live with his brother Silas, whom Maud has never met, until her majority. Putting the interests of one's child first would dictate that Maud go to live with her middle-aged cousin Monica, who has a lovely house, plenty of money, is fond of Maud, and actually does have her best interests at heart. But Austin is determined to have Maud live with Silas in order to rehabilitate Silas's reputation in the community: Silas was once accused of murdering a guest in his house, wrongly, Austin feels. If everyone sees that Austin has trusted Silas with the well-being of his child, they will stop believing Silas had anything to do with the man's death (which was, in fact, ruled a suicide). If Maud dies before Silas, he inherits the entire Ruthyn estate. What could possibly go wrong?|This novel had one of my now favorite new plot devices, the carriage ride that seemingly goes somewhere but actually goes nowhere. (It goes in an enormous circle, arriving back at its departure point, carriage inhabitants ignorant.) Supposedly Le Fanu got this plot device from something his great uncle Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the playwright, did once.|Someone should do a study of classic novels by male authors with first person female narrators in which the narrators opine about the characteristics of their gender. You get gems like this (Le Fanu via Maud): \\\"So Lady Knollys argued, with feminine energy, and I must confess, with a good deal of the repetition which I have sometimes observed in logicians of my own sex, and she puzzled without satisfying me.\\\" Translation: \\\"We ladies need to STFU, can I get an amen?\\\"|Then there was this 8-comma sentence, probably surpassed only by The New Yorker at some point....|\\\"I remember how, when, after we had got, late at night, into bed, I sat up, shivering with horror, in mine, while honest Mary's tranquil breathing told how soundly she slept.\\\" I know!

It is fast-paced, sweet-tempered, open-hearted, a golden book in many ways \\u2013 a paean to youth, to a future brimming with possibility, to a present that is lived vibrantly and joyfully. It is also about selling out, junkies, prostitution, and race wars. How can this be? I suppose it is all about point of view, and the protagonist\\u2019s perspective is the embodiment of Live Now and Love It. This is one of those rare novels that make the reader feel even more alive by reading it. The enthusiasm of its narrator was equaled by my enthusiasm of the world that MacInnes plunges us into headfirst. It depicts, it mocks, it leaps forward, it grabs your hand and carries you along.|I was young once, gosh, just a decade or so ago. I lived a life full of punks, hippies, goths, ravers, djs, fags, dykes, trans girls & guys, straight guys who made out with other guys and straight girls who were angry and ardent feminists, vegetarians and vegans, girls who stripped for cash in dives and guys who waved their hard-ons for free in print, fighters and peacemakers, guys who carved symbols on their bodies and girls who dressed like vampire princesses; we lived in junked-out flats filled with too many people, we shared clothes and went on road trips and had neverending parties and made protests against the government and danced all night and consumed amazing amounts of booze and drugs and sex and live music. I read Absolute Beginners during that period, and one of the best things about this novel was that it felt completely real and true to me, despite the difference in social scenes that were separated by decades, by an ocean. It showed the true diversity available to people in their late teens, in their 20s; it illustrated \\u2013 and so nonchalantly \\u2013 values that were not just held dear, but were unspoken, values that defied the middle class and that were simply assumed to be shared by everyone we knew. To read oneself and one\\u2019s peers in a novel written in 1958 is something special, something wonderfully moving to contemplate, even many years later.|What lifts Absolute Beginners above the idea that life for the young and unencumbered can be a great time, a fun carnival, is its complete awareness that this is also rather an illusion, and a crushingly temporary one at that. So many wonderful things can happen, so much excitement \\u2013 and yet the world around this world still exists to be fought against. For me and my friends, that world to rail against did not just include asshole yuppies who came to our neighborhoods from time to time, it included police brutality, the WTO, the wars abroad. In Absolute Beginners, that world above includes race warfare. \\\"Race\\\" is clearly interwoven throughout the narrative, and yet it is one of so many things that the narrator is aware of, just one facet of the world that the narrator comments on... the reader could almost lose sight of it. But race and racism are there the entire time and slowly but surely become the whole point; by the end, the reader and the protagonist see how fragile a life full of living can be when the world is singling out his peers for destruction, and those peers are turning to him for alliance. The protagonist chooses, and chooses well. But it marks an ending of sorts, an ending of an attitude and a lifestyle, and the beginning of an understanding that no matter what he and his peers have built, he lives in the world still, as does everyone, and that world is one of both wonder and horror. One of the reasons I picked up |Absolute Beginners| again was because of historian Dominic Sandbrook's daft grudge against Colin Macinnes (in |\\n|Never Had It So Good|\\n|). I last attempted it in my teens. It had been a slowish read \\u2013 proved to be the same this time round \\u2013 and was easy to give up on back then because the library copy was a horrible mouldy one. |Now, the vintage atmosphere and detail in the story was way more interesting so I hung around to savour that (when younger I'd filed this era as being 'before anything was cool'), noticing differences from the film musical, and processing the late 1950s slang. Plenty of 60s slang is still immediately familiar yet this stuff from only 5-10 years earlier, not immortalised in pop culture, can require a moment's thought to work out. These characters are the cool kids of my parents' generation, yet they are so different it reminded me how facile the idea of generation=social attitude can be. (One of the good points Sandbrook makes is that most people of this era, even the younger ones, weren't mods, hippies or their rock 'n' roll precursors, they were hardworking squares.) |There's something artificial about the way the main character loves the term \\u201cteenager\\u201d (as beloved of the media then as \\u201chipster\\u201d has been for the last few years, though back then there was more fear and real disapproval, rather than the contemporary eye-rolling). He likes defining what it means to be a teenager \\u2013 it's a culture at least as much as an age, squares aren't really teenagers \\u2013 and it's not that different from The Who's 'My Generation', by the time of whose release the narrator and his mates might (if they weren't still pop-culture purveyors) be boring oldsters. The over-consciousness of cultural definitions works in a way because he's one of those entrepreneurial kids who's interested in talking to the media and getting noticed by the movers and shakers (in an 80s or 90s setting he'd be a DJ / party planner, here he's a photographer, proto-|Blow-Up|) but it's also a reminder that |Absolute Beginners| was written by a champagne socialist easily old enough to be the protagonist's dad. Some of the press evidently loved it (a quote on the back from |Harpers & Queen| says \\\"Prose as sharp as a pair of Italian slacks and vivid as a pair of pink socks\\\", |The Sunday Times|: \\\"The cult novel of the year.\\\"). But I'd love to know what the real teenagers of the day thought of this book... Was everything in it so five years ago by the time they ever saw a copy? (By the 80s, presumably re-reviewing in the light of the film, the |NME| says \\\"Macinnes caught it first - and best\\\"; and Paul Weller, just born when it was published, \\\"a book of inspiration.\\\")|Some reviewers are critical of the way black, Jewish or gay people are described by the narrator. There's an element of positive stereotyping, complimentary or neutral description with frequent reference to some of the narrator's friends' background (how lively a friend's Jewish household is compared with his English one, there are white girls who fancy black men apparently because of sexual stereotypes, that sort of thing). But they have personalities too, and the narrator is way more inclusive and accepting than most of his contemporaries, even prepared to get injured defending his mates during the Notting Hill race riots. His way of speaking is what, over decades, evolved into the contemporary attitudes that mean it isn't okay to say the same things now. Such critics tend to dislike arguments for historical context, but if ever there was a good one for those people cutting a text some slack, it's with this book. |I'm kind of surprised to see so many reviews on here, and quite good ones, for |Absolute Beginners|; I'd had the impression its reputation was fading. Seems that inclusion in |1001 Books To Read Before You Die| has boosted it a bit. For my part I'd recommend it mostly for people interested in the social & cultural history, and for those who like some background to their vintage clothes/film/music habit.  A rather entertaining novel which evokes the emerging youth culture in Great Britain in the 1950s. An unnamed 18-year-old story teller searches for his own way in life, but obviously wrestles with the classic social conventions. The last quarter the book is more a description of the growing minority problem, including racial riots. The city of London shines through the book, and the author clearly shows his love for that city. Of course, this radiates the atmosphere of the times it was published (1959), with quite a few pages full of slang, but at the same time it has something refreshing. A plus also is the engaging style of MacInnis, with some razor-edge dialogues. Fun! Controversial. Interesting!|And you get to have the Bowie song in your head the entire time.

A good read and did well to portray the time and place but not the classic I was expecting. Definitely worth a read though. To be honest, this book was more interesting to me for its historical value than for anything contained in the story. Absolute Beginners' narrator felt like something of a dull archetype \\u2013 the arrogant late-teenager convinced he knows more than those around him, and unaware of his own failings. | Perhaps it was more of a novelty in 1958, when it was written. Which brings me to what I thought was most intriguing about the novel. To me at least, it read for all the world like the anachronistic work of someone writing in much more recent times about how they would have imagined the late 1950s to be. The passing references to running like Dr Roger Bannister or driving away from a riot like Fangio could so easily have been clumsy attempts to remind the reader that the story is taking place in a particular historical setting. But more than that, the anti-racist politics of the latter part of the novel, set against the background of the 1958 Notting Hill race riots, read to me like a modern liberal's wish fulfilment of what a white liberal kid in the late 50s might have made of it (though such an author would probably have refrained from having his narrator use the term 'Spade' to describe the black characters. MacInnes was, in this respect at least ahead of his time. Perhaps the more remarkable for the fact that he was already about the same age as the narrator's father and maybe this goes some way to explain another of the book's oddities \\u2013 the narrator's idiolect and use of slang terms I've never really encountered anywhere else. Not being old enough to judge myself, I might be doing MacInnes a disservice, but I couldn't help thinking of Anthony Burgess' made up youth argot from A Clockwork Orange. An moderately interesting diversion, which I'd picked up after hearing Andy Miller praising it on Little Atoms, but nothing more. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this. It's the first book of the year and the first book I had to read for this semester of university (for my post-1945 literature class) and it definitely sets the tone for a good year of reading.|It was way funnier than I expected and I really enjoyed the episodic element of the story. We basically follow the main character who is a young photograph in 1958's London through 4 different days in 4 different months of the year. The main character's narrative voice is very unique and it reminded me a lot of Alex from the Clockwork Orange in the sense that both characters invent their own slang and language through which they see and describe their world. The book is divided in four parts and every part is focused on one day. Even though at first the story seems to be a simple romance, it progressively gets more and more complicated as the author is getting closer to the events of the Notting Hill race riots in September of 1958. There is a strong element of diversity in the characters, we have black people, Indians, homosexuals, lesbians and more. MacInnes really strives to inform the reader of his time and bring to him a new understanding of the culture of these minorities, different from the way they were represented in the media.  A long summer in the London of the late fifties is the setting, as the nameless eighteen year old protagonist makes his living taking pornographic photographs in the few gaps in his hectic social life spent on his Vespa and in the coffee bars and jazz clubs. As the months pass he experiences friendship, betrayal, love and death with a motley cast of friends known by their nicknames, jobs or fashion sense; the deranged Wizard, the rentboy the Fabulous Hoplite, Mr Cool, the Misery Kid, Crepe Suzette and Ed the Ted. |There is the semblance of a plot, but this is driven by its protagonist, in whose character the reader is soon engrossed by, a teenager full of innocence looking at injustices around him, and deciding to act; particularly with regard to race, and the riots of the time. |Its about growing up, becoming wiser and yet remaining young and fearless, looking sharper and staying one step ahead of the crowd.|The book is rich in social history, with some wonderful descriptions of the city and the jazz of the day. As the 60s approach its the birth of the Mod scene, and quite inspirational.  I always had a soft spot for Julien Temple's film |Absolute Beginners|. I guess it was a bit overly ambitious to make a modern musical based on a 1958 novella, but I am grateful for the attempt. It produced a beautiful soundtrack featuring songs from Smiley Culture and the Style Council; wonderful vignettes from David Bowie (tap-dancing across a giant typewriter), Ray Davies, and Sade; and an opening sequence of black and white photographs from 1950s London which are nostalgic and heartbreaking to watch. And where did he get that great opening shot of Piccadilly Circus?!|I guess that's the real attraction of the book. It's an ode to a city that the narrator loves so much, it nearly breaks his heart. Colin MacInnes is keenly aware that he is writing about a time that is already in the past, that is already gone, that he already feels the ache of loss for. Basho might sum it up as \\\"Sitting in London, I miss London.\\\" The city as we imagine it isn't the reality and maybe that's what it means to be a teenager: that process of discovering that how you think the world should be isn't what it actually is. With that lesson, this is a coming-of-age novel in the spirit of Catcher in the Rye -- the love of place and childhood innocence that inevitably slips away.|The movie, for a musical, did capture a lot more in the book than I would have expected, but it certainly borrowed most heavily from the first and last chapters: meeting all of the narrator's Soho characters and the 1958 riots: setting and plot, and some rather slick dialogue. But being a musical, the movie is a bit shallow in character. The novel gives us two middle chapters which the movie largely ignores, but gives readers an insight into the inner thoughts and feelings of the narrator. The relationship of the narrator to his family and his father in particular is deeply touching. Despite the narrator's apathetic attitude to anything of seriousness and his dismissive attitude toward old-timers, past and present catches up with him.|This book has a special place in my heart and always will. I adore meeting all the characters in the narrator's life, and 1958 London certainly looks wild and fun, but the author's injection of pathos gives this cult novel an authenticity that makes it universal. (Although, I still feel I need a hip chat dictionary.) |Bonus takeaway: Hipsters seem even more derivative after this novel. On the plus side I could still remember whole scenes from this work although it has been at least twenty years since I last read it. The negative is that it hasn't aged well. It rings as true as a lead pound coin. The author's attempt to approximate working class and youth cultural speech is cringe worthy and patronising. The reality was that McInnes was from a middle-class background and grew up in pre-war colonial Australia long before the concept of the teenager as an entity existed. He vacillates between regurgitating media reports about the teenage phenomenon and preaching liberal-left propaganda. The cast of stereotypical characters are moved around a cardboard cut-out set reminiscent of an Edwardian child's toy theatre. As Colin points out to his older brother,|\\u2018In those days, it seems, you were just an overgrown boy, or an under-grown man, life didn\\u2019t seem to cater anything whatever else between.\\u2019|His generation, however, were not just following their parents or becoming father or mother clones. They were the first adolescent group to have money, their own clothes, and the first adolescent group to consider themselves \\u2018teenagers\\u2019. They were starting out from scratch, making it up as the went along. They weren\\u2019t just beginners in the world of adults. They were absolute beginners.| I am sure that the plot is that great or the ending that satisfying, but the whole thing is so vibrant that it just carried me along. I loved it.  Back in 1999 I watched a film called Quadrophenia, in which depicts the life of a mod: The clothes he buys, the music he listens to, the love for Vespas and the constant showdowns with rockers. I thought it was quite original ( I knew it was based of a rock opera) Now that I have read Absolute beginners I am certain that this book was clearly an influence.|The plot is about the life of a mod. It also focuses on the lifestyle. However, it is much more than that. For starters there are a lot of passages about the freedom that youth brings and how older generations do not understand them. The main character is a jazz loving 19 year old, just ready to enter his twenties and we get his views on how society looks in his eyes, the absolute beginners being the name he calls his generation. I guess one could call this book an early YA novel.|Absolute Beginners is a love letter to London: but not only the romantic aspect. Like Last Exit to Brooklyn, Macinnes mentions people who usually do not feature in books. Thus we get portrayals of drug addicts, black communities and the London gay scene. The final section on the book is a loose commentary on the immigrants which entered London during that time.|Did I like the book? Although I found it interesting, I didn\\u2019t gel with the narration style plus I did find it overlong, the first section could have easily been shorter. I do know that the book has an ardent following and is somewhat a cult classic. Lately I've been into mid-century books narrated by teenagers. While I was traveling in London a couple of weeks ago, I started reading |Absolute Beginners| about 1958 Notting Hill in the run-up to the race riots. Now I'm reading Jos\\u00e9 Agust\\u00edn's |La Tumba|, which was published in 1964 and follows a rebellious, literary teenager as he attempts to navigate the stiff, adult world of 1960s Mexico City. |I realized why I'm finding these books appealing when I watched the |recent documentary on JD Salinger|, author of perhaps the most famous midcentury book narrated by a teenager, |The Catcher in the Rye|. All teenagers feel alienated from adult society \\u2014 mostly because they refuse to succumb to the phoniness of it all. In order to become successful in life, you must accept a level of phoniness. You must learn to refrain from expressing certain opinions. You must master the art of sycophancy and tactical deference. Adult social interaction is, |in the words of Irving Goffman|, \\\"theatrical performance.\\\" |But teenagers aren't yet invested enough in their careers or communities to succumb to the phoniness. And so, refreshingly, they rebel against it. Teenage protagonists of novels are so appealing because, despite their insecurity and inexperience, they are authentic. They allow us to engage in the fantasy of doing and saying what we merely think because we're afraid of upset the theatrical performance of polite society.|Throughout my week in London, I became increasingly attached to the nameless, teenage narrator. |Absolute Beginners| is the British equivalent of beatnik literature. But instead of depicting the jeans-and-t-shirt-wearing literary beats of the US, we're entreated to a ragtag cast of |mods| and |teddy boys|, the two rival youth subcultures of post-war London. The novel depicts youth culture in London through the eyes of a precocious, empathetic teenager in the run-up to the |1958 Notting Hill race riots|. |The book is great social documentary of London's complicated multicultural coming of age through the eyes of a narrator's personal coming of age. It's also excellent fiction with a Kerouac-like unorthodoxy of prose. If you're interested in learning more about the 1958 race riots, BBC as a good |overview|, and |Stasy Adams| and |Nick Bentley| have written academic pieces on MacInnes's portrayal of 1950s London in his fiction. \\u201cNow, you can think what you like about the art of jazz \\u2013 quite frankly, I don\\u2019t really care what you think, because jazz is a thing so wonderful that if anybody doesn\\u2019t rave about it, all you can feel for them is pity: not that I\\u2019m making out I really understand it all \\u2013 I mean, certain LPs leave me speechless.\\u201d |\\u2015 Absolute Beginners|Colin MacInnes' novel \\\"Absolute Beginners\\\" (1959) is a wide-lens view of pre-Beatlemania London, with characters, images and ideas that remain pop fixtures: stylish, jazz-loving Mods; leather-clad, rock-loving Teddy Boys; the ascendancy of the teenager with increased income and diminished responsibility; and an atmosphere of combustible youth culture reacting to WWII-era morals.|\\\"Absolute Beginners\\\" is a remarkable period artifact for those reasons alone, but its literary qualities will surprise many readers looking for the cult novel that profoundly influenced Paul Weller. MacInnes' novel is energetic, lyrical and often brilliantly written. With its combination of cynical, stylized observation and dreamlike panoramas, \\\"Absolute Beginners\\\" feels like J.D. Salinger's \\\"Catcher in the Rye\\\" crossed with C\\u00e9line's \\\"Journey to the End of the Night\\\" and \\\"Death on the Installment Plan.\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0|The novel is less a plotted tale than a shifting, mildly surreal journey across London and its outskirts. Divided into four chapters, each section captures the events of a single day over separate months in 1958. The unnamed 18-year old narrator creates the impression of a \\\"Lord of the Flies\\\" social experiment in reverse, where teenagers have created a separate, superior civilization of freedom and literate sophistication. Living independently as a photographer in a diverse West End neighborhood, he encounters a range of colorful characters: the \\\"ponce\\\" (pimp) Wiz, the biracial Mr. Cool, the lesbian Big Jill, the violent and illiterate Ed the Ted, and his unrequited love \\\"Cr\\u00eape\\\" Suzette. The key conflicts are the threat of a race riot, the narrator's complex love for Suzette, whom he finds in a mariage blanc with an older man, and the sad expectation that youth's fleeting, ecstatic moment will soon fade.|With its unremitting imagery and stylized wordplay, \\\"Absolute Beginners\\\" is probably best read in a short immersive burst where its unique atmosphere can be savored before its novelty fades. Readers willing to surrender to its rhythms will discover an oblique, charged reality, a dreamily evocative Swinging London of the mind. Julien Temple's 1986 musical film adaptation, more \\\"Newsies\\\" than C\\u00e9line, suggests the challenges of filming MacInnes' vision. The participation of David Bowie and Ray Davies confirms its lasting influence, but it remains a unique, unrepeatable artifact. I had to take some time to organise my thoughts on this. It's difficult to assess exactly what I think of a book that is so firmly set in and attached to a particular time and place. A further problem is that the time is a couple of decades before I was born and the place is the opposite side of the country. As a result, I have no idea if the events or the narration of |Absolute Beginners| are in any way authentic. I also don't really care. The narration really reminded me of Anthony Burgess's |A Clockwork Orange|, not only because both books are narrated by disaffected youths but because there's also a similar rhythm and feel to it.|I found the first half of the book less interesting than the last. While I enjoyed bouncing around the London mod scene, particularly the nicknames and commentary on the other characters, I never felt very invested in the narrator's on/off relationship with Suze and really didn't feel that there was much tension in it. The sections I enjoyed the most were the home visits with his family and the race riots that conclude the story. I felt that his conversations with his mother and father really showed the generational disconnect without being overly dramatic or cliched. Both the family and race riot sections are when the prose comes out of the setting and moves onto more universal themes. |The race riot deserves its own special paragraph. This is the part of the book that I felt was truly great. The simmering tension that we feel before things start to get violent conjured up images from Spike Lee's masterful |Do the Right Thing|. Again we see themes and issues raised that are as relevant today as they've ever been. In particular, the way that racial tensions are exploited by tabloid media. Although the media featured here is print, today's TV news is every bit as bad and the tabloids are still what they've always been. The government and police are also criticised for their ineffectiveness, either through a lack of will or a lack of ability. The more things change... It\\u2019s London in 1958, and the narrator of Colin MacInnes\\u2019s novel is living in what seems to be a new-minted teenage paradise, where teens, for the first time, have money to spend and the freedom to spend. It\\u2019s a world where all races, creeds and levels of society mix, a world where the (never named) narrator feels totally at home \\u2014 the only cloud on the horizon being that the love of his love, Suze, has agreed to marry her homosexual boss as a front (homosexuality being illegal at the time). The narrator spends most of the first half of the book wandering round London, talking to Teddy boys, pimps, TV personalities, pop stars, jazz cats, fellow teens and advertising executives \\u2014 they all seem to know him, and many owe him a favour or two. Everything\\u2019s looking up.|But, no, it isn\\u2019t. 1958 was the year of some infamous race riots, and MacInnes\\u2019s narrator lives right in the middle of where they\\u2019re brewing. Also, his dad may be dying.|It\\u2019s a novel that seeks to capture the brave new world of its time, when life for its young narrator seems full of nothing but possibility, only to be suddenly dashed as he becomes thoroughly disgusted with the intolerance, violence, and sheer complacency his fellow human beings are capable of. It\\u2019s written in a rather odd style \\u2014 I\\u2019m not sure if teenagers actually spoke in this peculiar mix of mock-formality and jazz-like improvisation (it reminded me most of all of Anthony Burgess\\u2019s invented patois for |A Clockwork Orange|).

A slice of life shot through with bursts of teenage outrage and human compassion. Nice and short, too. I started reading this novel with bad intentions. I wanted to laugh at it. For some reason I assumed it was going to be corny, poorly written and absurdly naive... As it happens, it |does| contain some language that has dated in such a way that it brings a smile to the lips of the modern reader, but it's simply not possible to read this book right through with an ironic smirk. It's just too good, too exuberant, too smart, too accomplished, and the issues it raises are acutely appropriate for our own age.|The single quality about it that impressed me the most is the relative sophistication of the narrator in the essential political, cultural and social aspects of London life. Bear in mind that this is the 1950s. The narrator's attitudes are more advanced than those of the average person that I remember in my childhood back in the 1970s; and his style is a damn sight sharper. This book has changed my view of what life was like in '50s Britain. It wasn't |necessarily| all grey and bland... I wanted to read Absolute Beginners because of its ties to the development of Mod culture. I was expecting to get a glimpse into late 1950s British youth culture, but the book explores a whole lot more than that. I found the first 10 pages or so a little hard going until I got my head around the rhythm of the speech patterns, but once I was used to it and sorted out a few of the slang words it made for easy reading. |The first person narration really gives you a really personal look into the life of a main character with a very distinctive voice in quite a unique time culturally. At the same time MacInnes deftly weaves the bigger social issues of race, class, and sexual orientation into this very personal story, not unlike the way Christopher Isherwood captured 1930s Germany in his Berlin Novels.|Absolute Beginner's is not only a fascinating look into 1950s British youth culture, but British culture as whole just before the dawn of the far more documented 1960s. An interesting, thought provoking, witty novel set in London in 1958 and written in the first person from the perspective of an eighteen year old white teenage boy. He is a free lance photographer living in an apartment block. He is very social, mixing with a variety of individuals. He describes the smoky jazz clubs of Soho, the coffee bars of Notting Hill, his relationships with his girlfriend Suzette, his mother, father, siblings and friends.|I found the last fifty pages of the novel particularly interesting as he vividly describes the beginnings of the Notting Hill racial disturbances / riots from the perspective of a white teenager.|A worthwhile, rewarding reading experience. This book was first published in 1959. From BBC Radio 4 - Book at Bedtime:|Colin MacInnes's cult classic about teenagers, style and racial tension in 1950s London A lively story and thought-provoking at times. The copious slang reminded me of A Clockwork Orange. I rate it a four-minus.  This is the second book I read for the books1001 LiveJournal book club community. It was not one I would have picked up to read on my own, and probably wouldn't otherwise have finished even if I did start reading it. The reason is that I found the language difficult to follow, being full of slang and dialect that I am unfamiliar with. Also, after the first hundred pages or so, I realized that nothing was really going to happen. This book is more a portrait of a lifestyle, or of a generation, than a plotty story. Yes, there are some story arcs and character development, but they do not really generate a sense of tension or movement in the book. |Having said that, I was deeply impressed by the author's style of writing, by his use of vocabulary and image-building. I felt that I was there, in London of the 1950s, and was completely infected by the malaise, helplessness, yet hopefulness of the main character and his acquaintances. |======|And here is the more extensive review I posted on books1001:|Title: Absolute Beginners|Author: Colin MacInnes|Publication date: First published 1959, this edition re-issued 1986 by Penguin Books|# of pages: 226|Source: Bought used through Amazon.de (3 Euros + 3 Euros shipping)|Summary/Back of the book: It was the fag-end of a London summer in the fifties and change simmered below the surface... The young and the restless -- the Absolute Beginners -- were busy creating a new world of cool music, coffee bars and freer love, as different from Mrs Dale and traditional England's green and pleasant land as they dared to make it. Sharp, pungent, filled with the dreams and danger of city life, Absolute Beginners is now a brilliant film.|My review: The Great Gatsby, meet After Hours (1985 Scorsese film). Briefly: This is a book I wouldn't have picked up on my own, but I feel enriched after having read it.|There's not much plot: An 18-year-old Londoner who makes a living taking pornographic photographs wanders around the city, meeting up with various movers, shakers, pimps, prostitutes, and representatives of pretty much every disadvantaged and advantaged minority of his acquaintance. There are Jews, blacks, and Sikhs, lesbians and gays, white supremacists, gang bangers, television personalities, newspapermen and -women, socialites, songwriters, a diplomat, half-siblings, dysfunctional family members, an advertising executive, and lots and lots of jazz aficionados. And of course the requisite love interest, who is unhappily married to a gay man old enough to be her father.|The book consists mainly of the protagonist (who is never named) bouncing from one encounter to the next, partly driven by his need to hustle up some business and partly through sheer chance and the fact that he seems to know everyone who's anyone, and most of the people who aren't as well. The only loose plot threads that I could pick out were our boy's puppy-love pursuit of Suzette, and the slowly building racial conflict that explodes in the last section. I don't want to make it seem like the book is about race or class conflict, though; at least it didn't come across that way to me. It was more (again, to me at least) about the disconnection and rootlessness of the post-war generation.|There is so much that could be analyzed in this book, but I'll just touch on one point which I think illustrates this underlying theme. That is the lack of names for the characters. Not only the narrator, but many of his acquaintances are only referred to by various nicknames such as The Wizard, Call-me-Cobber, the ex-Deb, and Mr Cool. It is as if the narrator has rejected the names (and thus the roles) assigned to them by their parents, as representatives of the previous generation, and they are re-inventing themselves, or seeking their own identities and by doing so, re-defining the world itself.|Moving on to the other main point I wanted to discuss, I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with the style in which this book was written. This is the love part:|\\\"Up out in Pimlico, the old, old city raised her bashed grey head again, like she was ashamed of her modern daughter down by the river, and I went up the streets of dark purple and vomit green, all set at angles like ham sandwiches...\\\"|The imagery is pure poetry, and never degrades into cliche. I was mesmerized by the descriptions, and surprised time and again by the new and imaginative ways in which the author put words together to create an emotional impression.|But this is the hate part: |'And why, Ed,' I said, 'have you moved darn ear?'|'Cos me Ma as,' he said. 'She's bin re-owsed.'| |I find reading dialect tiresome, and especially as an American, it's difficult to figure out.|or:|And straining up the Portobello road, I passed a crocodile of infants, and among them a number of little Spadelets, and I noticed, not for the first time, how, in the underground movement of the juveniles, they hadn't been educated up yet to the colour thing.|This is an example of the pervasiveness of slang expressions; it took me a long time to eventually realize that 'Spades' are blacks. I still don't know what is meant here by 'a crocodile of infants'. This lack of understanding the vocabulary really interfered with the flow of the narrative for me.|(Side note: This book was made into a movie in 1986, which was a commercial flop. I would have liked to order the DVD as well, but I wasn't sure if it would play on my DVD player. Also, according to the Wiki entry, the story was changed quite a bit for the movie. You may have heard the David Bowie song of the same title, written as the theme song for this movie. It hit #2 on the U.K. charts.)|If you're looking for action-packed adventure or a heartfelt love story that will make you weep, this isn't the place to find it. But if you're looking for top-notch writing, deep thoughts packaged in entertaining and engaging characters, and a portrait of a generation that is both timeless and inextricably bound up in its setting, you should get a copy of this book and set aside an afternoon (it's a fairly quick read) to read it. I loved this book for its energy, its youthfulness, its optimism and its realism. Reading it made me feel like a teenager again - populated as it is with young people who were England's first ever teenagers (and doing far more with their youth than I ever did with mine). The distrust of adults and the scepticism of their austere rules creates a bubble in which young people move, with a freedom adults resent. |And of course, it just goes to show that the same arguments come round again and again. The Notting Hill race riots of 1958 were one more example of scapegoating minorities, and the narrator (author) is a refreshingly liberal voice from the era in the same way young people today are more accepting of difference and change. The unnamed narrator may use pejorative terms like 'Spade' and 'Poof', but he likes black people and gay people, and he sees no reason why what makes them different to the white straight majority should stop everyone getting along.|It's also an unromantic love letter to London. |So many great passages from the book that if I started quoting I'd never stop. I understand Absolute Beginners is one of three books by MacInnes themed on London and black culture in the 50s, and I'll get around to reading the other two some day. |(Despite being a massive Bowie fan I've never seen the film, but from what I know of it I can see how hard it must have been to capture the book's implicit wonder at being alive in any film starring Patsy Kensit.)|(Oh! But the theme song from the film is great.) After I got a little bit into this book, with its outdated slang and its theme of youth rebellion and after glancing at the copyright page -- it first came out in 1959 -- I realized, \\\"Ah, this is the British response to 'On the Road.'\\\" England is a smaller country, of course, so instead of tooling across the North American continent in search of wigged out jazz musicians and so on, the characters are taking cabs between Soho and Notting Hill to listen to some skiffle in a pub. And instead of Dean Moriarty's metaphysical yearning for a lost father, the main character stops in to visit his dad at his flat in Pimlico. Fair enough; there are still the junkies and queers. But even so, I started to notice something wrong: the slang, even given the trans-Atlantic differences, seemed a bit tone-deaf, and the characters spent too much time actually TALKING about the generation gap and \\\"teenagers\\\" instead of just showing what the generation was about. Then I noticed that MacInnes was born in 1914. What? Someone who was born before the Great War is trying to write a definitive novel about what it's like to be a teenager on the eve of the 1960s? It must have seemed revolutionary at the time, but now that people have their social history sorted out a little better, this novel doesn't quite work, even though Anthony Burgess actually called it one of the 100 must-reads of the 20th century, or something like that. Second in a trilogy. I'll give the other two a pass. Hugely enjoyable and a reminder that teenagers were not a construct of the 1960s. This is London in '58 - a mass of kids with attitude and cash, throwing off the shackles of post-war austerity and indulging in drink, drugs, casual sex and jazz. Everything that the oldsters hold dear is rejected, everything is new and fresh and has to have a new cool name (\\\"Fabulous Hoplite\\\" and the \\\"Ex-Deb-of-Last-Year\\\"). Our narrator is a teenage photographer out for kicks, a proper Londoner who can barely bring himself to move out of his manor and nothing gets him more than the friction between the indiginous brainless youth (The Teds) and the coloured immigrant labour (constantly and I'm afraid probably authentically called \\\"spades\\\"). Everything is in ferment - black against white, old against young, big ideas in the smallness of their world. A bible of late fifties cool. I love this book. I read it at that special time when I was a teenager as with Catcher in the Rye when these two novels meant the world to me because I could identify with the main characters. I am certain that if I first read them as an adult I would not hold these two books so dear. Nostalgia is a great thing.|I think Absolute Beginners suffered in popularity because of the 1986 film, as I recall they left out my favourite character The Great Hopite and I didn't care for all the Jazz hand/pointy toed pirouette dancey bits that were not in the book. It was definitely a cool trendy book to read before the film and now no one talks about it much which is a shame because it is a great book. Mysteriously out of print for many years, this classic novel of teenage life in fifties and sixties London charts the late and largely unlamented cafe bar culture of the period, full of sharp suits and casual violence. Despite being slightly dated, in particular due to its outdated terminology, the book evokes the period in expert fashion. It is chiefly memorable for its depiction of early immigration into Britain from Africa and the Caribbean. Made into a by all accounts lamentable film featuring Patsy Kensit.\",\n          \"If I had to describe this book in one sentence - little stories that magically contain big and excitingly complex ideas. |Writers aren't evaluated in the context of history as stringently as artists are. There are artists alive now who can paint with the technical bravura of the likes of Tintoretto or Titian but no one, understandably, is interested in their work. I suppose this conundrum was most famously demonstrated by the Dutch forger Van Meegeren who resented the fact that the art world showed no interest in his dated derivative work and so forged Vermeer paintings as if it's technical skill alone that distinguishes genius. Recently I read some of the books by William Trevor and you could say he too, like Van Meegeren was a forger. He appropriated the distinctive style of past masters - and yet, as if the past had never happened, he receives the acclaim no painter doing the same thing would get. What I'm getting at is that if you put Akutagawa in the context of history it's remarkable how innovative and pioneering these stories are, especially considering many were written before Calvino was even born (the writer Akutagawa most reminds me of some ways) and before Katherine Mansfield was being credited for evolving the possibilities of the short story. (How I wish she had read him!) Put him in the context of history and Akutagawa is a marvel. Not that he isn't a marvel whatever way you look at him.| Stand outs are his unreliable narrators in Rashomon where eye witnesses to a mysterious death all give conflicting accounts of what happened. Dragon: The Old Potter's Tale where a ridiculed monk with a big nose as revenge posts a notice declaring the dragon of the lake will ascend to heaven on the third day of the third month. Much to his amazement a massive crowd gathers on that day. Here, as DeLillo would be years later, Akutagawa is fascinated by the pull and power of the crowd. Red Onions where a young girl living from hand to mouth in a bedsit goes out on her first date and is suitably lit up by romantic expectation but discovers the highlight of the evening are the cheap red onions she stumbles upon (Akutagawa doesn't hold romantic aspiration in high esteem!) And finally the last autobiographical story where the narrator is plagued by a concatenation of disarming synchronicities which gives you an idea why Akutagawa was to kill himself soon after. |Brilliantly fresh and compelling from start to finish.  It is probably not very rare when an extremely gifted person emerges on this planet. But it is rare when this person manages to absorb the influences of many cultures and produce a very original innovative syntheses in his short life. The whole body of work that transcends the national boundaries and would influence a way of writing for decades and even centuries. I know only three names in the 20th century Kafka, Borges and now, Akutagawa. Notably he was the first. What unites all these three, they were born either into the culture without long established national literary tradition or in the time of dramatic changes of the society and literature. I would leave Kafka aside. But both Borges and Akutagawa were immersed in many different languages and cultures since their childhood. Borges has read even Don Quixote in English. Akutagawa was reading both Japanese and Chinese traditional literature as child but also hungrily absorbed almost 200 years of the Western literature by the age of 18.|My first encounter with Akutagawa was unsuccessful. While at university, I\\u2019ve picked up his collection of short stories and found them too stylised and boring. Now many years after, my view has changed almost to the opposite extreme. I can read him many times and never get bored. In fact, I absolutely admire the versatility of his gift. His variety of styles is exceptionally wide. And he was always experimenting with his method and searching for new techniques through his short life. He never was totally satisfied it seems. He changed the decorations and styles. But there is one thing which always present in his tales. It is authenticity of human feelings. It is also amazing how many writers he anticipated, including Kafka and Borges but even Knausgaard though it might sound incredible to start with. |I\\u2019ve read much bigger volume of his stories in Russian. Not that big part of his work has been translated into English. But I think this collection contains many of his best tales with a few notable exceptions. I would just pause on a few to underscore the versatility of his gift:|\\u201cRashomon\\u201d and \\u201cIn a Bamboo grove\\u201d. Those two are the most famous as they were the base of the movie by Kurosawa. But purely from the perspective of the literature, the second one stands out. Apparently it is the first time ever when a bunch of unreliable narrators are describing the same story from the different perspective, contradicting each other. And the single \\u201ctruth\\u201d is never revealed. Robert Browning apparently did something similar in |The Ring and the Book| but Akutagawa raised it to the totally different level with the open ending. Now we are so much get used to this tool. But even from the perspective of our century, this is the one of the most elegant and economically told stories of this type.|\\u201cHell Screen\\u201d - this is not a medieval tale. This is a philosophic investigation about the dominance of the high art over reality. Apparently Akutagawa visited an anatomy morgue to write this story.|\\u201cThe story of head fell off\\u201d - it is included here in a comical section, but there is nothing comical about this story. And the image of a deep blue sky getting closer and closer would stay with me for a long time.|\\u201cGreen onions\\u201d - this story I would not be surprised to find between early Chekhov tales. How our high expectations from life often end with the prose of the aforementioned vegetable.|\\u201cHorse legs\\u201d - purely from the land of Kafka.|There are a few of the notable omissions in this collection:|\\u201cThe Yam Gruel\\u201d is translated into English. It is included into |Rashomon and Other Stories|. It is a tale about the feeling of a \\u201clittle\\u201d person modelled on Gogol\\u2019s Overcoat. As far as I remember, Gogol\\u2019s character dies from the shock of loosing the overcoat. But Akutagawa has twisted the tale asking very different question: what if he would get what he dreams about? And there is no Akaki Akakievich. He has been replaced by a samurai.|\\u201cHandkerchief\\u201d - It is available in English as well. It is included into |Mandarins: Stories by Ry\\u016bnosuke Akutagawa|. The collection of the recently translated stories by Archipelago press. What a clever short story this is! On the surface it is about East-West and its mutual accommodation. But this is not a simple story. It is one of those tales like a matreshka doll. You\\u2019ve opened one not expecting to find another, but it is in there. And then - one more. And the smallest one does not look anything like the initial one and leaves you puzzled what was the story about really.|Now the section called \\u201cAkutagawa own story\\u201d. While reading the introduction in my Russian collection, I\\u2019ve learned a lot about the state of the Japanese literature at the time. Due to the Meji reformation and opening to the West, they tried to build up their modern literature by absorbing around 200 years of the Western Canon. Obviously they were loosing themselves in the process. Apparently they did not have a concept of a novel per se. So in 1885 Tsubouchi Sh\\u014dy\\u014d (1859-1935) a literary critic, translator of Western literature, and novelist formulated the principle for the Japanese fiction in his work\\u00a0Sh\\u014dsetsu Shinzui\\u00a0(The Essence of the Novel). He came to the conclusion that the descriptive realism should be the way to go. This has apparently helped to focus the minds of the Japanese writers. |Many of them has taken the idea even a step further following the theory that only object a person could know truthfully is her/himself. As a result they developed something called |\\\"I-novel\\\" (\\u79c1\\u5c0f\\u8aac, Shish\\u014dsetsu, Watakushi Sh\\u014dsetsu)| where a writer would describe both his mental and physical life in its daily details with the varied level of psychological depth. So the fashionable 21th century auto-fiction was in fact born in Japan about a century earlier. I was amazed to find that out. But why i am talking about it? Akutagawa initially considered it more or less as lazy and limiting exercise. But then, at some stage, in his last decade he has started to experiment with the method. At the same time he kept experimenting with the style, used huge range of framing devices from the letters to the dialogues and the sketchs of unwritten novels (the device later successfully used by Borges who loved Akutagawa's work). He also kept his psychological complexity in these stories. And his very last tales before his suicide are read more like impressionistic pieces full of terrible beauty rather than the confessional tales. |One serious omission form this part of this collection is \\u201cDialogue in darkness\\u201d, the story that is written as a conversation between Akutagawa and the angel or maybe he is the fallen angel who has become a devil. I\\u2019ve searched whether the story exists in English. But did not find anything conclusive. The story was published posthumously. And I wanted to finish with the quote from there:|D. You will very likely die soon.|Akutagawa: But that thing which has created me at the first place will create the second me.|And the \\u201csecond him\\u201d is the powerful and omnipresent influence in the world literature since. \\u201cIn fulfillment of his longstanding dream, he became the author of several books. But what he got in return was a desolate loneliness.\\u201d| |This collection offers a piercing insight into the stunning yet troubled mind of Ry\\u016bnosuke Akutagawa. A writer brought to the world by a madwoman, he was a well-known insomniac, a drug addict, a guilt-plagued sinner, yet he produced such beautiful works while hounded by the looming shadows of his inevitable insanity. |This masterwork can be adequately divided into three parts: the first part (A World in Decay & Under the Sword) are vivid myth-like stories set during the Heian, Kamakura, and other pre-war eras of Japan. From the titular story of an encounter under the Rash\\u014dmon (a gate built as a monument in the southern entrance of Kyoto) to the story of a painter who perfectly depicted the fury of hell into a screen, the first few stories present such beautiful and breath-taking pictures of early Japan in all its splendor with its unique culture and oriental beliefs in full display. |The second part (Modern Tragicomedy) are surrealistic stories set during Akutagawa\\u2019s lifetime towards the dusk of the Meija era and the early smoldering of the Taisho. These haunting yet humorous stories reflect the slowly decaying psyche of Akutagawa as his fears and nerves start to take hold of his pen. |And the last part (Akutagawa\\u2019s Own Story) are his final manuscripts towards the end of his life when all he could muster to craft were words formed by his horrors and his painful loneliness. In one of its few bright spots he writes, |\\u201cIn my savage joy, I felt as if I had no parents, no wife, no children, just the life that flowed forth from my pen.\\u201d| But these last few remnants of thought from this gifted storyteller evoke mostly the sorrowful darkness of a mind in despair whose only solace was literature. The different eras of Japan were his canvas, his brushstrokes his blood, wrung out unbearably, drop by drop, till he had none more to bleed.|\\u201cI don\\u2019t have the strength to keep writing this. To go on living with this feeling is painful beyond description. Isn\\u2019t there someone kind enough to strangle me in my sleep?\\u201d| |What initially was a beautiful and elegant collection morphed into an outpouring of literary agony towards the end. In this regard it is like a Chimera, a two-fold beast, formed by the fictional beauty of Akutagawa\\u2019s tales and the painful terrors of his grotesque reality. One night, I woke in the dark hours no longer able to sleep. After a while I accepted my semi-wakeful state and found my way to the sofa. There I settled under a blanket and flicked ideally through the TV channels, eventually I happened upon a film |Ghost Dog|, not apparently to be confused with |Moondog| | although to my mind ghost dogs and moondogs must be much of a muchness, no? |, anyway the film seemed to be pleasing pretentious and about right for being neither asleep nor awake but watching moving pictures on a screen. Two of the stories in this collection were made in to a film, but the powers of the night which decide our sleeping have so far not decreed that I must see that film in the early hours of a star lit morning so I haven't.|As it happened the film made mention of the story collection | Rashomon| which seemed to be of some importance to the title character and his philosophical stance and so when it came to pass that I was gripped, not by midnight wakefulness but by mid-afternoon book madness, I ordered it from the library and in time it came to me from Gravesend, so if you are in Gravesend it will be a couple of days before it is back with you - patience!|Akutagawa chronologically is approximately a contemporary of Katherine Mansfield, he also died young and was much concerned in his fiction with death and psychology, but unlike her at least based on the stories I've read, he has a broader range of story settings and is somewhat less interested in gender and romantic relationships. In this volume the stories range from the title story set in medieval Japan to the recent past to his own days in inter-war Japan. Both Mansfield and Akutagawa were fellow travellers in their modernism, attempting to capture the fleeting contact of human awareness of the moment and the fractured, unreliable perception of an individual.|Really these are stories one could read repeatedly and I recommend them warmly, despite the grimness of the autobiographical ones which twist around fears of madness and thoughts of suicide | which ultimately led to the end of the author's own life|.|Yes, Modernism, madness and death - everybody's favourites, I am plainly really going out of my way to encourage you to try these. So what can I say that is a bit more tempting? Dare I mention the wide range of styles, the sometimes uneasy mixture of the Japanese and the European? Akutagawa was a big fan of Dostoevsky and the fin de Siecle writers, indeed one story here may be a Japanesed version of Grushenka's Story of an Onion from |The Brothers Karamazov|, then again it could be, I suppose, a Buddhist folktale. There's also a lot of humour, in different registers, in one story a man in Manchuria suddenly finds he has horse's legs and we find that eventually nature is stronger than nurture, in another a waitress struggling to get by on romantic dreams and a low wage, might be about to be seduced by a man when she spots spring onions on sale at a bargain price. |So great variety and a glimpse into the troubled soul of another person, quite a lot in just over two hundred pages of extremely short short-stories. And there's more... an introduction by Haruki Murikami assesses Akutagawa in the context of a Japanese writer attempting to find his own voice while drawing upon both Japanese and European literary heritages; 'I love Dostoevsky and Strindberg and Flaubert and I am a discipline of Natsume Soseki'. Murikami holds that Akutagawa's literary dead end in trying to marry the traditions in himself led to his physically premature dead-end, in which case the introduction is a kind of meta-fiction and we can read all eighteen stories in the collection as nestled within it the multiple attempts of a prisoner to escape their unique cell. He tries historical settings, Chinese settings, contemporary settings, he draws on his life experience, his personal history as a adopted child is reflected in his divided literary heritage, so we are treated to a fireworks display of creativity, it has to stop of course, as all fireworks' displays must, but it is spectacular while it lasts.|The perfect example of Murikami's point is the story | On a Bamboo Grove| which places the reader in the position of an examining magistrate of early medieval Japan - we read a collection of testimonies relating to the discovery of a dead body in said bamboo grove. Are any of them true? Even taking the testimonies together and mentally reconstructing events is that the truth of what happens? Is there an objective truth beyond that a man who was once alive is now dead? For practical reasons in daily life in order to have a functioning legal system we pretend that this is so, but as a writer appealing to readers Akutagawa makes a different point, the same one maybe as he makes throughout all these stories even or particularly in the fictionalised ones based on his own life. For a person drunk on the film society culture prevalent in Kerala during the Seventies and Eighties, \\\"Rashomon\\\" is a magic word.|Akira Kurasowa\\u2019s film enjoys cult status among movie buffs. It is rivetting in its presentation of \\u201ctruth\\u201d in many layers, presented as a conversation among three people: a woodcutter, a priest and a commoner who take shelter under the ramshackle Rashomon city gates to escape a downpour. The story is the death (murder?) of a man, the rape (?) of a woman and the capture of a bandit responsible (?) for both: as the story unfolds, the differences in the widely varying testimonies of the people involved force us to have a rethink on what \\u201ctruth\\u201d means.|I had heard about this movie a lot before actually seeing it; and it lived up to its hype and more when I finally got around to seeing it. But this review is not about the movie. It is about the magical short story which was its inspiration \\u2013 and other stories like it, penned by one of the great figures of Japanese literatures, the turn-of-the-century novelist Ryunosuke Akutagawa.|When I first saw the movie, I was so taken up by the sheer visual beauty of Kurasowa\\u2019s storytelling that I did not ruminate much on what this movie was based on, even though I saw the \\u201cbased on\\u2026\\u201d title in the beginning. It was only after joining Goodreads that I came to know about this book, and was immediately hungry for it. Having read it, it has left me hungry for more by the same author, and Japanese literature in general. It is so shattering in its impact on the intellect, even in translation; I cannot imagine how powerful it must be in the original Japanaese \\u2013 for, as Haruki Murakami says in the introduction, the translation can never capture the power of the original.|Akutagawa is a tragic figure. His mother went mad shortly after his birth, and he was raised by his childless maternal uncle and aunt. Even though they were a highly cultured family and young Ryunosuke was lucky to have a childhood exposed to a lot of intellectual pleasures, he was constantly plagued by ill-health and bullying in school. His ill-health continued into youth: he suffered from chronic insomnia and fears of madness. The misfortunes of family and country also distressed his oversensitive soul to an inordinate extent. Until finally, on 24 July 1927, Ryunosuke Akutagawa committed suicide by an overdose of Veronal.|The author\\u2019s gifted and tortured soul is visible throughout this amazing collection of stories. It is divided into four sections: (1) A World in Decay, (2) Under the Sword, (3) Modern Tragicomedy and (4) Akutagawa\\u2019s Own Story. These sections correspond to four periods of Japanese history as well as four creative styles which took birth from Akutagawa\\u2019s fertile imagination.|In the first section, stories (most of them retelling of old legends) set in the Heian Period (A.C.E. 794 \\u2013 1185) are included. This was Japan\\u2019s classical era; a time of peace, prosperity and opulence when art and culture flourished. But as is common with most ancient kingdoms, it declined and power slipped from the hands of the aristocrats into the hands of the warlords. It is this twilight period that Akutagawa uses as a backdrop for his stories of degeneration and decay. The title story of the collection, Rashomon, encapsulates the entire misery of the country in the symbol of the gate of the capital city of Kyoto. The city having been struck by one calamity after another, the author says:|With the whole city in such turmoil, no one bothered to maintain the Rashomon. Foxes and badgers came to live in the dilapidated structure, and they were soon joined by thieves. Finally, it became the custom to abandon unclaimed corpses in the upper storey of the gate, which made the neighbourhood an eerie place that everyone avoided after the sun went down.|The stage is thus perfectly set for a set of disturbing stories. |Rashomon| narrates the story of a jobless servant who is sheltering from the rain inside the gate and an old woman, who steals hair from the corpses lying there to sell to wig-makers, justifying it by pointing out that the dead people were also thieves and cheaters. Ultimately, she inspires the servant to become a thief himself who starts off on his new career by stealing her clothes!|In a Bamboo Grove|, one of the most extraordinary stories ever written (this was the inspiration for Kurasowa\\u2019s film, even though he used the Rashomon gate as a symbol of the decay he was portraying) narrates story of a dead warrior, a thief and a raped woman from the viewpoint of each of the protagonists. Each of the stories is different and equally believable from the evidence available at the scene of the crime and the statements of the witnesses. Who we believe will depend a lot on who we are.|But the story which impressed me most in the whole volume is |Hell Screen|. This gem of a novelette gives us a taste of horror, Japanese style \\u2013 I could understand how movies like |Dark Water|, |The Ring| and |The Grudge| came into being. The tale of the deformed artist Yoshihide (nicknamed \\u201cMonkeyhide\\u201d because of his deformity), the tapestry of hell he paints for the Lord Horikawa, the artist\\u2019s daughter who is a serving girl at the Lord\\u2019s mansion and the pet monkey has all the elements of a medieval ghost story and a gothic romance. However, it is Akutagawa\\u2019s narrative style (whereby he leaves a lot unsaid) and his choice of the narrative voice (that of an unnamed member of the Lord\\u2019s retinue) that are masterful. The story is a one way ride into darkness.|In the second section, we move forward to the Tokugawa Shogunate (A.C.E. 1600 \\u2013 1868). This was the last feudal military government of Japan. During this period, the shogun elders of the Tokugawa clan ruled from Edo Castle. As Jay Rubin, the translator, says, the Tokugawa centralised feudalism \\u201cimposed the principle of joint responsibility on all parts of society, punishing whole families, entire villages, or professional guilds for the infractions of individual members. This fostered a culture based on mutual spying, which promoted a mentality of constant vigilance and self-censorship.\\u201d|In the story |Loyalty|, the disastrous effects of the madness of a samurai on an entire dynasty is described: in this merciless world, it does not mean just the destruction of a person, but of a whole bloodline. The other two stories included describe the clash between Christianity and Japan\\u2019s traditional religions. These distressing tales are rendered with much empathy and wit.|In the third section we find a sarcastic Akutagawa, full of black humour. |The Story of the Head that Fell Off| and |Horse Legs| use the trappings of fantasy to create a sort of darkly comic tale. In |Green Onions|, we can see an author smiling at himself and his fellow-scribes, in a pastiche of a romantic tale.|There is a whole tradition of autobiographical writing in Japan, called \\u201cI-Novels\\u201d, where the author\\u2019s life itself is fictionalised. Even though Akutagawa initially stayed away from this genre, he finally succumbed to peer and critic pressure and started writing such stories. It is here that one can see a fine mind finally unravelling. There are hints of this in the first three stories, especially in |The Writer\\u2019s Craft| where an author is forced write an elegy for somebody whom he barely knows; just on the strength of his writing talent. This sense of unease is increased in |Death Register| where he tabulates the demise of friends and relatives: and in |The Diary of a Stupid Man| and |Spinning Gears| (where Akutagawa keeps on hallucinating spinning gears on one side of his vision), we sense that we are standing on the edge of a minefield. (|Spinning Gears| was published posthumously.)|This is a well-chosen set of stories, with a fantastic introduction by Haruki Murakami. There are explanations about the historical periods, and background information on each story. The timeline of Akutagawa\\u2019s life is also provided. The book satisfies one, not only literally, but also as a window to Japanese literature.|Highly recommended.|Review also posted on my |\\n|BLOG|\\n|. Good, but...| Yes. I did it. I've committed one of the ultimate literary sacrileges of all time. I read Akutagawa Ryunosuke in translation when I could have read it in original Japanese. I am guilty as charged. I just couldn't resist a book with such a cool cover and Murakami's introduction |plus| his trusted Jay Rubin doing the translation. |Having said that, I did read it along with the actual Japanese text in front of me to see how well Jay Rubin has grappled with difficult early 19th-century Japanese and rendered it into English. And the result was somewhat disappointing. I think he does a good job translating Murakami's works, but here with Akutagawa, he pretty much butchers most of his early stories that take place in medieval Japan (which stories, by the way, are usually extolled as his masterpieces). The original Japanese is, of course, in medieval Japanese, and it is quite different from modern Japanese (but not as different as modern English to Chaucer's middle English). But Mr. Rubin sometimes translates conversations into highly colloquial English, and that just doesn't work with Akutagawa's early stories.|The Japanese language - still today and even more so back in the day - is a very |polite| language, which logically makes it a very |vague| language as well, where curse words don't really exist and you say things in a very roundabout way. And to render this into modern colloquial English is like equivalent to rendering Shakespeare into today's slang with an abundance of \\\"F\\\" and \\\"N\\\" and other such words. Now from a reader's point of view, Mr. Rubin's translation is very readable. Very. It could have, however, been a lot more conservative on the use of colloquialism and slang without compromising its readability. |For example, in one of the scenes, a lord tells his trusted servant to kill someone, and the original reads more or less, \\\"Kill that man, that Rin'emon,\\\" which Mr. Rubin translates as \\\"Kill that bastard!\\\" Alright. This does show the degree to which this guy is mad (in fact crazy), but I'm sorry, that just doesn't work. The word \\\"bastard\\\" is just way too much of a bad word for someone like a lord himself could utter (and I don't think there was an equivalent in medieval Japanese). I do recognize the difficulty since the Japanese here is very very subtle. The meaning is close to \\\"bastard,\\\" but a LOT less blatant than what the English word conveys. In many many instances Mr. Rubin resorts to colloquial English that sounds too jarring to a Japanese ear when compared to the subtle nuances and beauty of the original Japanese. But that's just me, who is fortunate enough to be able to read both Japanese and English with more or less equal fluency. So as far as the translation is concerned, hats off to Mr. Rubin for making Akutagawa's stories easily available for the English-speaking public, but as an artistic work, it could have done much better by avoiding too much colloquialism and using more formal (and even a bit archaic) English to better convey the original voice of the text.|W/r/t the stories, they are really good. I'd even say he's Japan's Chekhov. In fact, you could see an exotic blend of Kafka, Gogol, Chekhov, and even Dostoevsky at work behind these stories. My personal favorites are his famous \\\"Hell Screen\\\" (intense and just awesome), \\\"In the Bamboo Grove\\\" (Kurosawa's Rashomon is based on this), and \\\"Horse legs\\\" (which is very Kafkaesque and just funny). \\\"Loyalty\\\" is also excellent in terms of it psychological insights. Though I wasn't a big fan of his later, autobiographical stories, they were strangely engaging. It's just too bad that one of his most famous stories, \\\"Kappa,\\\" is not included in this collection. Overall, it's a good short anthology of Akutagawa's stories. I was Compelled to read this after loving Akira Kurosawa's classic film. Most of the stories are superb, with Akutagawa's prose full of such fluidity. He really catches you out with some beautiful quirks of description, sharp bouts of humour, and many revelations in a short space of time that it's no wonder he is considered one of Japan's greatest short-story writers.

About a third of these stories are easily knock-out 5-star fantastic. The other two-thirds I'd rate mostly 4 stars with a few 3 stars. All worth reading and in general I think this is probably a good intro to Akutagawa's work in that it contains a nice cross-section of his work from the earliest historical stories to his later primarily autobiographical stories.|I personally preferred the earlier stories which ranged from tales of Samurai warriors and Shoguns and stories of religious persecution when Christianity was making inroads in Japan to satyrical stories about unfortunates with big noses.* While the settings are completely foreign to me, the characters are people I know all too well. My favorite story being \\\"Hell Screen\\\" in which an egotistical painter is commissioned to paint a screen depicting the horrors of hell. In order to sketch the scenes, he puts his assistants through a myriad of tortures and all I'll add in an effort to not give too much away is that karma is a bitch! These early stories have an almost Victorian gothic creepiness to them but it's a bit more subtle and far more insidious in that it seems infinitely more real. And Akutagawa has a nice dollop of humor running throughout these early stories as well.|The later autobiographical stories in which he writes of his mother who went mad, of his infidelities and his fear of going mad himself and his increasing depression that led to his eventual suicide are painful to read in how human and easy to relate to they are. But having read Dazai's similarly themed autobiographical stories not too long ago, Akutagawa didn't have quite the gut punch that Dazai had for me. Akutagawa's story \\\"The Spinning Gears\\\" was the best of the autobiographical bunch for me. Throughout, he continues to have visions of gears that nearly block out his vision. Those of us who have the luxury to think about life beyond just worrying about food and shelter can probably all relate to this nightmare of the cogs of life just taking over. The horror element of his earlier stories definitely comes into play here.|There's a slightly strange intro to this collection by Haruki Murakami which is far more critical of Akutagawa's work than I might have expected though it did seem like a relatively fair critique. I'm glad I read it after reading the stories though.|-----------------------|*When I studied Chinese, my teachers were all native Chinese, mostly on exchange and when we learned the word for \\\"nose\\\" we also learned that Americans are frequently called \\\"big nose\\\" so I had a good chuckle seeing that the Japanese are equally amused by big noses. I always think I don't enjoy short story collections. There're sometimes one or two short stories that I find interesting but others often merge into the formless forgettable mass (unless it's Alice Munro and then there are none). Then I encounter a collection like this and start doubting my preconceived ideas about my relationship with the form. |This was a fascinating collection. Starting with Akutagawa's take on the old stories and ending with closely autobiographical confessions of the paranoid depressed macabre mind. |Akutagawa is very well-versed in the western literature, he's particularly attracted to the psychological novels of the 19th century. I can see Poe's eerie influence in \\\"Hell screen\\\" story (one of my favorite retellings of the old tales), I also see Gogol in \\\"Horse legs\\\". And then there's the heartbreaking cycle of autobiographical stories of unravelling mind. He is lonely, perturbed, obsessed with death, self-doubting and struggling with inferiority complex regarding his skills, continually calling himself an idiot. This is an anxious, ill mind you're uncomfortable to spend time in, not gonna lie. (the last two stories are published posthumously after he killed himself, the second story was left unfinished, his brain just gave up on concentration needed to finish a story)|All in all, a very interesting collection I recommend to everybody: first stories to lovers of myths and fables; and the last stories to lovers of psychological. What I love about Rashomon is that it signifies pretentious snobbery so perfectly. Like, if you want to impress someone at a cocktail party, \\\"I didn't understand truth until I saw Rashomon,\\\" you might say. Did I say impress? I meant impress upon them that you would be super boring to go on a date with. You can win any argument by nominating Rashomon because no real people have actually seen it.|Anyway, I haven't seen it.|I read the book though! Here it is! No, not the one called Rashomon. That's actually about something totally different. Rashomon the movie was mostly based on a different story by this same guy, called \\\"In a Bamboo Grove.\\\" I know this from |reading the introduction.| Would you like to go on a date with me and I'll tell you about a pretentious movie I haven't even seen.|What book do you think is the Rashomon of books? Like, how could you instantly signify that you're pretentious? Is it Proust?|Things You Can Signify With Books|On The Road:| I will not be good in bed.|Jane Austen:| I haven't read a classic since high school.|Ulysses:| oh, this is probably the pretentious one. |What's your idea? Tell me - YOU RIGHT THERE, I demand that you tell me a book and what it signifies when a person claims to be a big fan of it.|Whatever, here's the thing, those are both wonderful stories but who cares when you've got something called HELL SCREEN coming your way.|HELL SCREEN|*heavy metal music*|Hell Screen is so fucking great, it's this Poe / Wilde / Faust thing where an artist can only paint from life and then he's asked to paint hell and you can pretty much see where this is going. There's a monkey.|Akutagawa is one of Japan's most famous writers. He wrote mostly short stories like these here. He committed suicide in 1927 when he was 35, overdosing on sleeping meds across the room from his wife and kids. All of the stories I read in this collection were perfect. Look, it's not that HELL SCREEN is the best name for anything ever and any story not called HELL SCREEN is stupid, but...it's not not that, either.  Akutagawa known as the |\\u201cFather of Japanese short stories\\u201d| stays true to his designation with this collection of metaphysically refined stories. The rendered stories: - The Grove, Yam Gruel, Rashomon, Martyr to name a few; highlights Akutagawa\\u2019s preference for macabre themes of immortality, depression, virtue, chaos and death. These stories encompass a constant battle of skepticism prevailing over virtue of morality v/s existence of evil.| | In Rashomon, the act of the ghoulish old woman picking out long hairs from the skulls of the corpses to make wigs and sell them to buy scraps of food delineate a desperate act to fulfill the demonic perils of life. Similarly, 'Martyr' highlights the thriving soul of hypocrisy in religion and the susceptibility to strong gossip.| | Akutagawa\\u2019s affinity for such themes brings out his real tumultuous relation with mental anxiety and clinical neurotic dwelling of his personal life. (He committed suicide at the age of 35 due to an overdose of Vernol). Furthermore, his description of kimonos/garbs adorning his protagonists illustrates a high usage of the color blue which in Japanese culture is the color of naivety,immaturity and youth.|  First read in 2007|In his characteristically measured, conversational introduction to this book, Murakami Haruki tells us that Akutagawa is his third favourite author in the modern (post 1868) Japanese canon (after Soseki and Tanizaki). Rather than giddily enthusing about the author, Murakami carefully contextualises him in Japanese literature and culture. Akutagawa lived during a brief period of prosperity and political liberalism between WWI and the Depression in 1929, and combined appreciative immersion in Japanese cultural life with passion for Western literature. He called Soseki 'The Master', and worked as an editor as well as writing; the autobiographical stories in this collection demonstrate the literariness of his short life.|As well as drawing on his own daily experience and mental anguish for source material (a form related to the 'I-novel' style of some of his contemporaries in Japanese literature), Akutagawa wrote stories set in the Edo period when Japan was governed by military overlords. Many of these have interesting historical content. He also wrote stories of his own time, with an amusing self-awareness. The writer is always a presence, even if only in the pleasurable excess of musical names.|His style is clear, lyrical and pierced here and there by vivid images, like the purple sparks made by the tram on the overhead wires that the narrator wants to hold in his hands. Murakami says 'the flow of his language... moves along like a living thing', and this translation by Jay Rubin certainly preserves this natural, dynamic, unforced quality. |One technique that I particularly liked and that is original or at least unusual is the one he employs in 'Hell Screen' as well as other pieces, that of using a disapproving narrator to tell the hero's story. This device not only actively engages the reader's sympathy with the protagonists, but also creates a deep and nuanced impression of social exclusion and isolation. \\u201cThe cable was still sending sharp sparks into the air. He could think of nothing in life that he especially desired, but those purple sparks\\u2014those wildly-blooming flowers of fire\\u2014he would trade his life for the chance to hold them in his hands.\\u201d|I came upon a review comparing Akutagawa\\u2019s writing to \\u201cshoots of flame visible through the snow\\u201d (quoting a Mishima story), which is very apt. Akutagawa\\u2019s writing burns with a lurid glow\\u2014well suited to his macabre sense of humor. Less so in the later stories in this collection, with his fear of madness, and his thoughts of suicide (which he would eventually commit), and his misgivings about living a life of literature. DNF @ 39%|These stories are not bad but I just can't muster any real enthusiasm for them.|It is not helped by the stories being unconneced and by themselves not being great examples of the short story format.|Of course, they were not written as short stories in the Western literary sense. It's just that the way they are written is boring me stiff.|Maybe I'll pick this up again at a later date, but right now, this is not working for me. Akutagawa is one of my favorite writers. He took his own life with barbiturates at age 35 and left behind some 300 stories, sketches, articles and literary experiments. In English he has appeared in over a dozen collections of the same 20-30 most famous stories retranslated a dozen times. This latest collection, translated by the consummate Jay Rubin, has a lovingly detailed introduction by the inimitable Haruki Murakami. It is a mere sampling of 18 stories from his impossibly good body of work. Unlike Toson, Soseki and Tanizaki, Akutagawa did not embark on massive literary projects. Instead, he honed his craft with precision and an appreciation for classic storytelling. I have read some of his stories ten times, and they always elicit a strong response from me. |In a lot of ways, he resembles Gogol, and even composed an homage with his story \\\"The Nose.\\\" Though different in content, the tone is reminiscent of the Russian master. This is one of the masterpieces contained in this treasury. The others include: \\\"Rashomon, In a Bamboo Grove, Hell Screen, Spinning Gears, Death Register, and the Life of a Stupid Man.\\\" Even the ones that are not masterworks per se, are extremely entertaining. \\\"Green Onions, The Story of the Head that Fell Off, Horse Legs, and Loyalty\\\" fall into this category. If you are new to this author, you may not enjoy all of his tales, but I believe you will appreciate many aspects of his singular talent.|He writes a few different types of stories: 1). retellings of classic tales from Chinese and other sources. These read a little like fables. 2.) Autobiographical tales: these are often depressing, taking details of his haunted life and casting them bleakly against the backdrop of his times. 3). Religious tales like \\\"Christ of Nanking\\\" (not included in the collection) and others. Historical tales, taking place well before the author's time but possessing uncanny verisimilitude.|In his stories you will find traces of his influences: Anatole France, Strindberg, Merimee, Goethe, Nagoya Shiga, Soseki, Toson, Tanizaki, Basho, Doppo, Ogai, Pu Songling and dozens of other European and Chinese authors. He has rewritten stories from Pu Songling's collections as well as retold many from the seminal Japanese proto-mythologies.|Akutagawa draws from Buddhism, Shintoism, Christianity and Myth. I think he is one of the most interesting writers I have ever encountered because he processes other literary worlds into new forms. Even when he waxes esoteric, he is charming and insightful. He explores human nature with deep characters and memorable comedy and tragedy.|This brilliant edition includes thorough notes by Rubin explaining the finer points of the stories. There is enough material in this singular Penguin edition to write a dissertation on Akutagawa. Jay Rubin has put in an astounding effort toward accuracy and illumination. I only wish he would continue with further volumes of stories.|If you appreciate the stories of Chekhov, Gogol, Maupassant, and Dostoyevsky, you will find a lot to love about this author. Typically, you can expect tortured artists, explorations of morality and death, futility and hope, love and loss. Very classic themes. \\\"Green Onions\\\" and \\\"O-gin\\\" were odd but welcome selections for this book. Overall, it is the most well-rounded collection of the author's writings in English.|I have so far discovered 107 Akutagawa tales in English. I've read every anthology of Japanese literature, every collection of his tales and tracked down out of print Japanese-American periodicals through JSTOR. I want to thank Ryan C. K. Choi and N. A. Feathers for publishing new translations of his work on their websites. This incredible author has not gotten a full treatment in English and I implore translators to get to work on making his complete works available. So far we have only about 900 pages of stories, when obscure, ancient masters like Pu Songling have been translated more comprehensively. Along with this collection you will want to read two more collections: Mandarins, translated by Charles de Wolf, and The Beautiful and Grotesque, which includes \\\"Kappa,\\\" his novella.|Though Akutagawa's accomplishment is profoundly important (far more so, I would argue, than Murakami claims in his indicting introduction), one wonders what heights Akutagawa might have reached had he endured the agonies of his intellectual rigors for decades longer. Was he capable of writing novels? Were the demons he wrote about in \\\"Spinning Gears\\\" exaggerated or as sincerely recorded as in Strindberg's Inferno? These questions will never be answered. But part of his appeal is how digestible and varied his work is.|This is undoubtedly one of the greatest short story collections by any Japanese or non-Western author. Throughout my life I've been experiencing the strangest tendency when reading a really great literary work: after finishing a particularly brilliant passage/story/poem, I just have to put the book down for while, to stop reading it altogether as if I was afraid that this was the peak and nothing better will follow. Sometimes this takes days of sweet pondering upon the writer's craft. I like savouring these moments, they occur rarely, bringing me much pleasure and gently nudging me into thinking about beauty. Many Akutagawa's short stories gave me this feeling, especially those that were about medieval Japan and the samurai (especially |In a Bamboo Grove|, |Hell Screen| or |Loyalty|). I find it extremely hard to comment on such brilliantly crafted small literary worlds. It's always difficult to describe perfection, you just have to experience it and then you know: this is |it|. I feel the compliments are also in order for Jay Rubin, the translator, who rendered these stories so beautifully into English.|On the other hand, this book seemed utterly depressing to me. Akutagawa is preoccupied with death and suicide in quite an unhealthy manner, which is surely due to his mental illness. Naturally, this issue is a fact of life, not a bad thing in itself, but the way this volume is compiled and filled with incredibly elaborate commentary on the autobiographical element of his writing, one sort of feels like sinking into that utter darkness with the author (the most dismal posthumously published stories are ordered in the end of this compilation). Thus, Akutagawa would be one of those artists that I put into a special category of mine - the writers that I consider truly gifted (if not even genius), but for various reasons I can't relate to them personally. |His own works were unlikely to appeal to people who were not like him and had not lived a life like this| ...as Akutagawa wrote himself. He tells us later that he is the one that believes in the existence of darkness only, not in the light. It leaves me just wondering how much of this is the result his depression or unhappy personal circumstances and how much the influence of fin-de-si\\u00e8cle literature he was devouring, an influence on his life that is duly acknowledged. |So, there he is - a master of words, a strange man... I guess this is the black and the white of this reading experience. A damn intense reading experience. Pre-review:| to tell the truth, the reason why I finally got my lazy butt up to seriously read contemporary Japanese literature (aside from the usual reads of Haruki Murakami, Yukio Mishima, Rampo Edogawa and all the other Japanese crime and mystery good stuff etc) is this: the |Bungo Stray Dogs manga seriess| LOL|\\n|\\n|Early this mornin', when you knocked upon my door|Early this mornin', ooh, when you knocked upon my door|And I said, \\\"Hello, Satan, I believe it's time to go\\\"|Me and the devil, was walkin' side by side|Me and the devil, ooh, was walkin' side by side|-Me and the Devil Blues-|Robert Johnson|\\n|\\n|(1) So far I am still in the Introduction part, but an introduction written by Haruki Murakami is definitely worth reading, for example, the part he commented as a novelist that Akutagawa's use of language is 'sharp and beautiful', the way he analysed another artist's works, his personal history and faimly history and the historical background! And it doesn't surprise me that he compares Akutagawa with Fitzgerald! (the short essay Murakami had written about Fitzgerald is beautiful as well). |(2) The Nose is an interesting case study of human emotions of shame, pity, self-image and malice.|(3) the fact that Rashomon is among Akutagawa's first short stories is quite impressive, and in Chinese we still use the term 'Rashomon effect' a lot. LOL|(4) When I was re-reading |The Spider Spread| and |Hell Screen|, I feel a sense of despair: Heaven is too far away but Hell and its darkness is hot on everyone's heels.|(5) But somehow I think the movie adaptation of 'Rashomon' (actually the movie is the mixture of the short stories |'Rashomon'| and |'In a Bamboo Grove'|) is a bit more impressive than its novel counterpart.|More to come. \\\"Rashomon\\\" tells the story of a \\\"lowly servant\\\" sheltering from the rain on the steps of a rashomon (outer castle gate). He has recently been laid off and sits pondering his future. He hears a sound and ventures inside the rashomon to see what it was. Inside are heaps of dead bodies from the recent plague and a strange old woman wandering about, going through the corpses' clothes. The servant attacks the old woman, strips her of her clothing, throws her onto the heap, and runs off. |\\\"In a Bamboo Grove\\\" features a married couple and a robber. The story is told from the perspective of all witnesses and it emerges that the husband was murdered but who did it and why is the mystery. |These are the two most famous Akutagawa stories and are an excellent start to the collection. However, afterwards they become quite mediocre and even a bit tedious. The forced gothic of \\\"Hell Screen\\\" plods along until a near hysterical ending that undermines the seriousness of the story, that of obssession and the artistic mind. \\\"The Nose\\\" is a very odd story about a priest with a very big nose, has it shortened, and it grows back again. It's one of those \\\"be grateful for what you have, accept who you are\\\" type tales and not nearly as brilliant as Gogol's \\\"The Nose\\\" (Gogol being one of Akutagawa's influences and, frankly, a better short story writer). |As the title suggests there are 18 stories here but those are the only ones I can remember. The last couple in the section called \\\"Akutagawa's Own Story\\\" are interesting, with \\\"Life of a Stupid Man\\\" playing with form and presenting an interesting take on autobiography through small snippets of a life glimpsed in passing. \\\"Spinning Gears\\\" is the final story he wrote before his suicide (pills) and is about the slowly disintegrating mind of Akutagawa. The desperation and mounting paranoia give the reader an insight into Akutagawa's fragile and fractured mindset. The strange imagery is also fascinating. The spinning gears he sees around his eyes confuse and scare him while at every turn he sees signs of death - a decaying animal corpse, dying people in hospitals, and above all his morbid fear of going insane like his mother. |I won't say I didn't enjoy the book as there were some stories here that were excellent, and whether it's Jay Rubin's translation or not, the writing was always of a high standard. And students of literature will find reading \\\"Rashomon\\\" and \\\"In a Bamboo Grove\\\" very rewarding as will film students who are interested in the work of Kurasawa who based his film \\\"Rashomon\\\" on those stories. But compared to other short story writers and other Japanese writers, Akutagawa isn't nearly on their level.  Delving into Japanese classics had always been a goal of mine since I started reading more frequently. Akutagawa Ryunosuke was the first Japanese author I've read of with his work Life of a Stupid Man, an incredible piece of literature in my opinion. So here I am delving into his more of his works.|Instead of talking about this book in general, I will make a weekly discussion to dissect each short stories in depth on my Instagram @agathachristiebells. I will try not to be spoilery but if you have read it or maybe wanted to know more, there are amazing reviews and analysis online that talked about the stories in more details.|CW: suicide|Akutagwa Ryunosuke was known as Japanese Father of Short Stories. His sharp literary style and usage of language were never stagnant: \\\"it moves along like a living thing\\\". He published Rashomon in 1916 at the age of 23-years-old and was praised by the legendary writer Natsume Soseki. Akutagawa brilliantly crafted a story from classical works into a contemporary modernist literature that transcend generation. Unfortunately, he commited suicide at the age of 35, in which he wrote actively for only twelve years in his career. |1.Rashomon (1915)|Rash\\u014dmon in Kyoto was the grander of the two city gates built during\\u00a0the Heian period (794\\u20131185). In this story, calamity had struck the city of Kyoto caused a decline to the capital. Set in Heian Period, it is a tale of an ex-servant who in a precarious situation of being left homeless after he was fired from a job. In order to survive the night of a stormy weather, he decided to take cover in the abandoned gates filled with corpses. He then encountered an old woman suspiciously prodding around the corpses.|This was fairly short with 7 pages long of we looking at the unnamed character and his actions and decisions in the moment. There is an internal struggle of choices between surviving but with a price to pay or died alongside the corpses. There is symbolism in here that subtly present though not obvious and I found it on a reread, they are much clearer. This one was a good introduction in this book and sets the pace of the book well. |2. Hell Screen|Yoshihide was known to be the best painter but with an ugly face and not an ounce of compassion to others with an exception of his daughter. When he is tasked to create a painting of Hell Screen by Lord Horikawa, a powerful authority whom coveted his talent but despised Yoshihide's unseemingly arrogant behaviour who thinks he is above others and his disrespect towards culture and religion, Yoshihide fell into the dark abyss of hell on earth. |This story depicted artistic obsession and dilemma similarly Akutagawa was towards his writing. Yoshihide is obssesed with his art and the only emotion of love he had was for his adolescent daughter, a compassionate and mild mannered girl. Yoshihide's passion towards art border into madness as he painted from observation and gained the picture by real life depiction rather than imagination such as rotting corpses and dreams of his encounter with the Hell Wardens.|His tendencies to paint real life depictions gave the authentic feeling to his painting but he sacrificed many things in order to reach the state. His sacrilegious behaviour torturing his apprentices indicate his manic tendencies to achieve perfection even go as far as the act of a devil. This story blew my mind. Its so briliantly written with introduction to characters, the peak of insanity, unexpected and twisted climax which ends on a depressing conclusion. A well crafted story that showed human's greed and jealousy can burns the world as if hell exists even in the real life. |3. In a Bamboo Grove|A reread. I have read this short story three times and it still remains vague and ambiguous on the actual truth. |The story questioned on how our memory can be unreliable and each persons had their own subjective experiences on seeing the same things thus giving different answers to one question. |It started with the testimony of a woodcutter then a travelling priest, a policeman and an old woman on the killing of a 26-year-old Kanazawa no Takehiro who found stabbed in a bamboo grove. We then get a confession from the killer, the wife of Takehiro Masago and in the end, the spirit's confession himself through a medium. What really interest me was the fact all 3 people involved in this incident had different stories showed that they either embelish or exaggerate their stories according to their own principles. One in anger, another for honour and lastly to subdue the shamefullness because of lust. Its an interesting take on how we convey our words in order to make it look differently from others.|In the end, we don't know the absolute truth as we can only relies on the statements and confession given by the witnesses and suspect as each person gave their words according to their own advantage either to save honour or cover for others. It was left to our own interpretation.|TW: sexual assault, physical assault, animal cruelty, arson, suicide|The second section of the book titled Under the Sword comprised of 3 stories: Dr Ogata Ryosai's Memorandum, O-gin and Loyalty. |In this section, the stories mostly based during the period of rules by Tokugawa shogun. Tokugawa ruled the country with power and force in fear of any rebellion and being overthrown. This time, the fear or threat from Christianity religion which is starting to make an impact on the people, Tokugawa was afraid of this thus there are punishment and execution for those who practiced the faith. |4. Dr Ogata Ryosai's memorandum ( 1916)|Following the memorandum of Doctor Ogata, this reports on a widow named Shino who has a young daugther that fallen ill. She was a practising Kirishitan or Christian thus causing her to be abhored and pushed away from the neighbours. In desperate need for help, she seeks Dr Ogata to see her daughter's sickly state but due to her religion, the doctor refused unless she abandoned the faith. |Interestingly, this story pit religion and family together. Its a story that shows the choice between keeping your religion or choose your flesh and blood. Certainly, its a notion that is cruel but soon we will see what fate arrived to Shino as she decided on her own as she was pushed to commit an unwilling act for her daughter. In the end, there is a twist of fate and it may seems unbelievable but a miracle do occur.|5. O-gin|Opposite to the miracle in the earlier story, this one questioned the choice make by the character. O-gin is an orphan girl who lost both of her parents at young age and she was adopted by a couple who are Christian though not many people know about it. They however were caught by the Satan and brought to the magistrate for cruel punishment and forced to denounce their faith. At the time of execution, O-gin decision to back away from Christian crumbles down as she realized she can never go to Heaven and abandon her birth parents whom she believed are in the depths of Hell.|This story made me think a lot on the choice of religion and family again. Being loyal to the religion in here meaning you are abandoning your family but O-gin decided to not be selfish and instead chose her parents. Its a debate of choice and weighing the importance of these two things in life. This will make an interesting discussion.|TW: murder, decapitation, graphic violence|6. Loyalty|This is fascinating as the terms loyalty coined to the person served to a bloodline. In here, we see a head of a household, a samurai started to have fits and nervous breakdown that ultimately led him being out of boundary and potentially harming the family's name. The Elder of the House decided that the master should refrain himself from attending any events that take place in the castle in fear of him embarassing or bring disgrace to the family. The elder is more loyal to serve the house than his own master thus lead to him being almost killed but instead he left the house, no longer want to serve the family. The next elder appointed is more accustomed or acquaintard with the house master as he seen him grew up and here, he is more loyal to the master than the house itself. So you see there is a different loyalty in the same household. There is a disatrous event occured after the master decision to go to the castle for last time before he retired causing the destruction of his whole bloodline. |Around this time, Akutagawa himself seems to be having his own nervous breakdown. This story may reflected his own mental state as the main character seems to fear almost everything and lashed out whenever something ticks him. |7. The story of the head that fell off |Set in the backdrop of Sino-Japanese War where tension is rising between China and Japan, war destroyed many people. Xiao-er, a chinese man went to a fight with Japanese cavalrymen and as he clash swords with them, he felt a sword hit his neck and then he ran away atop of his horse to flee from the dire situation. He fell from the horse, on the verge of his death, his past life started to passed by him in shapes of the clouds, his mother's apron, the field of his home, the foot of a woman he loved and the festival he attended. Slowly, he startdd to regret his past actions and want to live a better life. Soon after, a newspaper stated an accident of a human head falls off after a brawl in a diner. |This story was sort of a dark comedy/humor because there is a twisted ending of the man. Regrets came too late for him despite many things. In a way, this story showed that humans somehow will always make bad decision even though they always said they will do better next time.|7/9/2021|8. Green Onions|Interestingly, in here Akutagawa breaks the fourth wall and was present in the story by saying he need to complete this story in order to meet a deadline. It gave a slight humor although as always, there is something to be taken from the story itself. |O-Kimi, a beautiful young waitress in a cafe had fallen in love with a young charming Tanaka. O-Kimi had this childlike or romantic notion of love , potraying the ideal image of Tanaka but she also knows that he could not possibly be perfect. However, when someone is in love, they tend to put a rose tinted glasses on and admire the person so much, they will look past their lacking. When both of them are on a date, Tanaka harbours an ill intent that may occur if not for O-Kimi's attention diverted to green onions on display in the street neighbourhood. What exactly is the significance?|Simple as it is, she was awaken to the reality of economic and financial situation she was in after seeing the green onions' price. She was worried about her rents, next meal payments, and obligations in her life other than romantic relationship with Tanaka. There is a potential danger when Tanaka invited O-Kimi to a house they are supposed to go but this was stopped by his sight of her with the green onions on her arms. As if all intent vanished the moment he sees her that way. |9. Horse Legs|This is fascinating. Hanzaburo suddenly passed away but turns out, this was a mistake by the grim reapers and they eventually returned him back to the living world. However, here's the problem, Hanzaburo had died three days ago, his legs had start to become rotten and in order to cover this mistake, the grim reapers replaced his legs with horse legs. Hanzaburo was devastated and in order to conceal this hideous facts, he kept his legs in boots all the time and never let other people see his legs.|Content warning: Death, suicide, attempted suicide, affairs|10. Life of a Stupid Man|\\\"I am living now in the unhappiest happiness imaginable. Yet, strangely I have no regrets\\\" |\\\"I may wear the skin of an urbane sophisticate, but in this manuscript I invite you to strip it off and laugh at my stupidity\\\" |I almost cried just by reading these words. |This was my 3rd time reading this stories. Its an autobiographical stories comprised of 51 short anthologies or rather I would call it Akutagawa's musings on his life and principles. It was published posthumously after his death by his close friend. Attached to the manuscript was his letter to him which said he is entitled to release this stories but must not identify or put a names to the people he spoke about. |Cadavers|\\\"If I needed a corpse, I'd kill someone without the slightest malice. Of course, the reply stated where it was - inside his heart\\\"|Man-made wings|\\\"At twenty nine, life no ponger held any brightness for him, but Voltaire supplied him with man made wings. |\\\"The higher he flew, the farther below him sank joyd and sorrows of a lifr bathed in the light of intellect\\\"|We started with his descriptions of his mother whom he described as lunatic and whom he barely have any affection for but also afraid he becomes like her as he lives each days with fear. Then, we moved slowly as he grow to become a writer but pressured to concur with the writing industry, married to a woman he loves but end up in affairs, growing passion for arts and philosophy but also contradict most of them, become a father but felt he is useless and unsuitable and each time he muses on death and what does it mean to live. |The Birth|\\\"Why did this one have to be born - to come into the worls like all the others, this world so full of suffering?\\\" |Comic Puppet|\\\"He wanted to live life so intensely that he could die at any moment without regrets\\\"|Stuffed Swan (this particularly hits me the hardest)|\\\"As he thought about his life, he felt both tears and mockery welling up inside him. All that lay before him was madness or suicide\\\"|I couldn't put into words or make a proper dissection on this one because its personal and raw and basically him telling his own stories in the most vulnerable state he was in, secrets being unburied, darkest desires and emotions being poured out, philosophy shared and contradicted and generally him saying he is unable to be a man worth enough to live. Its quite painful in a away but subtly conveyed in each short passages he wrote. |Interestingly enough, he wrote these using third point of view as if it was another person but it was actually him. Maybe he tries to separate the creation he wrote about from his life but he knows so well it is him and will always be him. |11. Death Register|In here, we see his life in full lights with him describing the death of his insane mother, an elder sister he barely knew, and the father who left him when he was an infant but always tried to reconcile with him somehow. Akutagawa doesnt get love from his real parents but he was given plenty by his adoptive parents. This was poetic and lyrical piece of essay he wrotes on each of his family members and ones that I felt most attached to was his recall of his father's dying on his deathbed. Such a sad moment. The story ended with a haiku as went to visit the graves of his beloved, his thoughts of them dying as if they are fortunate enough to die rather than live.|12. Dragon: The Old Potter's Tale (1919)|- Similar to The Nose, this story also points out on appearance and religion where the Buddhist monk named E'in had a giant nose and this caused him to be the centre of jokes by many. In order to divert the attention from his looks, he concoct a revenge by putting a signboard saying that a dragon will ascend to heaven on the third month. The words spread around like wildfire, even if people had doubts, majority believed the news and soon anticipate the event. Eventually, the day come and thousand of people gather to see the dragon but does this dragon even exist?|The theme of religion and physical appearance were themes that Akutagawa explored most in his work and this one spark more interest in the question of whether the prank could actually be true. Jay Rubin mentioned \\\"Dragon\\u00a0toys with the likelihood that religion is nothing more than mass hysteria, a force so powerful that even the fabricator of an object of veneration can be taken in by it.\\\"\\u00a0|The question whether the dragon does ascend remain vague as we are unsure whether it exist or the people in the midst of waiting for hours too invested in the notion of wanting and believing the dragon, conjure up the image of dragon. Its fascinating but as always the ending remain inconclusive. |13. The Spider Thread (1918)|Its a very short story but concise in conveying the message. Talked about sinner's and how one act of compassion lead to a help from the lord above but a greed will cause the downfall. Kandata, a vicious murderer was punished in the lowest of Hells but his action of letting a spider live ultimately gave him a help to climb to heaven by the spider thread. There are depiction of gruesome hell and its a terrifying scene. For someone as selfish as Kandata who won't share his help from above with others eventually lead to his eternal damnation in Hell |An interesting twist of fate is that I was surprised that an anime Erased I just finished watching had a connection with this story I read yesterday. The anime talked about this short story and it was so twisted in the mind of a person and I was pleasantly surprised by the coincidence.|It was published for children based on Taisho fairy tales|14. Spinning Gears Verdant vignettes vibrate across the reader\\u2019s eyes, as the are drawn into the splendiferous similes which dance across the page, shimmering like the pale reflection of sun-light on pebbles in a Japanese garden. Akutagawa fused he aesthetics of haiku with the psychology of Dostoevsky and other Western writers; style and form are as central to his stories as structure, psychology and characters, yet few short story writers are able to match the sheer diversity of Akutagawa\\u2019s ouvre; whether it be Gogolian fantasy in \\u2018The Nose\\u2019, discourses on the power of art in \\u2018Hell Screen\\u2019 or proto magical realism in \\u2018Horse Legs\\u2019, the breadth of Akutagawa\\u2019s stories in immense.|The highlight of these stories is undoubtedly \\u2018Hell Screen\\u2019, a macabre exploration of the darker elements of artistic inspiration, as the titular character, the morose and morbid painter Yoshide, tortures others to gain inspiration for his depiction of hell. Other highlights include, \\u2018In a Budding Grove\\u2019 which explores the nature of narrative perspective and was the inspiration for Kurosawa\\u2019s \\u2018Rashomon\\u2019 and \\u2018Spinning Gears\\u2019 a playful and poetic l pieces which reminders the reader of the jejunish experimental fiction of Oulipo. |Interspersed within the short stories are some strikingly pretty images, such as;|\\u201cPine boughs stretched across the empty sky, and in them hung a copper-coloured moon devoid or radiance.\\u201d|\\u201cA butterfly fluttered it\\u2019s wings in a wind thick with the smell of seaweed.

It was an abundant field of ripened wheat sprinkled with wild roses\\u201d) or of the aspiring artist, Yasukichi, whose cloyingly clich\\u00e9d funeral orations are held in higher regards than his art. More than this, his stories are about love and disillusions and jjoys there is something quintessentially modern the urban romance in \\u2018Green Onions\\u2019. Akutagawa is, along with Chekhov and Katherine Mansfield, one of the greatest short story writers.  I would highly recommend this edition which has introductions by Haruki Murakami and translator Jay Rubin. Additional commentary and notes by Jay Rubin help you to understand background of stories. Akutagawa basically created many of his stories from ancient Japanese fables. However His autobiographical stories rely on theme of loneliness and death. I have found this theme in all other Japanese literature which I read. If you want to read Japanese literature then I think Akutagawa's name should be at top of your list. Japan's highest litaeture award is named after Him. |I got to know Ry\\u016bnosuke Akutagawa in 2014 because of art movie Ghost Dog : Way of The Samurai. Jim Jarmusch is one of my most favourite filmmaker and I absolutely devour His movies. The film borrows a lot of elements from French movie Le Samoura\\u00ef, Seijun Suzuki's Branded to Kill.|Just like central character of Le Samoura\\u00ef, Ghost Dog lives his criminal life with Samurai code. He is seen oftenly reading Hagakure by Yamamoto Tsunetomo and shows liking to Ry\\u016bnosuke Akutagawa's rashomon and recommends it to a minor character.  The stories included in this collection reflect an author who is intelligent, well-read, perceptive and deeply aware of human foibles. Half of the short stories are very entertaining and revealing, written in the cadences of ancient Eastern folk tales. |The author wrote these stories in the book in the years 1915 to 1925, in Japan, using Chinese and Japanese literary and cultural themes. But they not only educate the reader in the themes of Eastern literature, they also demonstrate that humanity is the same whether living in the East or West, no matter what century. The way people feel about the mysteries of their lives is the same whatever the setting. At the same time, the different, distinctly Eastern cultural prism through which our commonalities present themselves reflect a Japanese view in these stories that is a bit mystifying, and very interesting. |This collection includes two very famous stories, \\u2018Rashomon\\u2019 and \\u2018In a Bamboo Grove\\u2019, which were combined together into the plot of a famous Japanese movie, which in turn Hollywood has not so aptly attempted to imitate in several variations. A character\\u2019s character in point of view is certainly shown to be important in deciding veracity of a tale! |For the record, in the story Rashomon I believe the ghost, Tekehiro, is the most truthful. I believe he incorrectly reads his wife's actions and motivations, but he was the most truthful as he understood what happened.|Tekehiro\\u2019s wife, Masago, saw in Tekehiro what she interpreted as contempt in his face after she was raped. I believe she misread her husband's emotion. She saw what she feared most. She continuously lost consciousness and was extremely stressed. She had been raped, after all. Tajomaru, the rapist, was also a braggart and a criminal. He probably did not feel he would be let go or considered innocent after his capture by authorities. He would be most interested in inflating his actions, so I don't believe him in that there was a fight between him and Tekehiro. |After raping her, Tajomaru, I think, added insult to injury and tormented Masago, only increasing her distress and her certainty that her husband would despise her. In reality (?!?), the thief only wanted to rape, torment and rob the couple. Masago would have been wild with shame and fear of rejection by her husband, as well as feeling hopeless in having been degraded. |Tekehiro would have been dishonored and shamed by his impotence, greed, dupability and perhaps his suspicion that his wife lost respect for him. This would lead him to believe she could easily want him dead for that, and thus he would be blind to how she might be hiding her own shameful acts of wanting to save her life and honor by going with the thief, whom she believed wanted to take her with him (I think that's what he whispered to her in the short story). |The thief forced her to publicize her choice of living over loyalty, so, by his trick, she shamed herself twice over by her choice of deserting her husband. When the thief revealed his trick, she was triply humiliated - first the rape, and then her choice of deserting her husband, then in being fooled and rejected. After the thief left (why would he untie the husband, realistically?) I think, unable to face her wretched self-betrayal and afraid of her husband's supposed need for revenge and rage, she did try to stab him, but perhaps incompetently. She was 19, a young girl. After she ran away, her husband killed himself in self-loathing. The girl's mom said he was kind at heart, and he was a man of honor. At least that's how it makes sense to me, given what I know of human nature.|Of course, uncertain narrators abound, so what all of us judges can go by is what we know of human nature along with the testimony. Akutagawa has made the reader one of the characters in the story, has he not? As judges, truth must be assigned as a probability instead of a certainty. Although I believe in my above synopsis as the closest truth, Tajomaru confessed. I believe he raped and robbed and played a horrible spiteful trick on the couple which doomed the marriage, but as a judge, I don't believe he dueled or killed the husband physically. Tajomaru committed soul murders on the couple, perhaps. But Tajomuro has confessed out of misplaced pride and braggedo, and I'm happy to condemn him for the murder, given no other physical evidence.|The author is so clever. Now WE know the uncertainty of determining truth of phenomena which is dependent on human interpretations of reality. I have become an unreliable narrator.|I completely disbelieve the Woodcutter. Despite appearances of being disinterested, his story does not make any sense unless you accept the complete dissonance of a young wife being more like a hardened psychopathic prostitute moments after being abducted, imprisoned, and raped, by an armed man threatening death and humiliation. |Later stories included in the book, from 1925 to 1927 are more autobiographical or personal, and while revealing how similar that people feel about fear, stress, anxiety, and how we live within communal society, sadly, these somewhat autobiographical stories show how the author is losing his equilibrium and peace of mind. It is difficult to parse out if it is the fear of going insane or if it is actual instability precipitating the author\\u2019s emotional frailty. When I read my first Murakami, a compilation of short stories called \\\"After the Quake,\\\" I was amazed by his refreshing originality. Some of his stories, indeed, had the effect of an earthquake to me. There were jolting, sudden and unexpected turns. In one, a man and a woman, after a brief introduction, make love. Then, out of nowhere, the man felt a sudden impulse to kill her. In another story, the characters were on a beach. Tears suddenly flow down from the eyes of one character, then they talk of killing themselves. Developments like these come without warning as they were not even hinted in the previous narration.|Now, it can be told. This style of storytelling is not at all original. Murakami, I think, copied it from this great Japanese writer who killed himself in 1927 at the age of 35--Ryunosuke Akutagawa (in the list of the 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die he's under letter \\\"R\\\"--a mistake, because his surname is Akutagawa, not Ryunosuke). By his own confession, Murakami has been reading Akutagawa since he was a teenager.|I bet that if one includes Rashomon in that compilation \\\"After the Quake\\\" an uninitiated reader will not find any difference between it and the rest of the stories there except that the latter have modern settings while \\\"Rashomon\\\" is set in 12th century Japan.|\\\"Rashomon\\\" (\\\"Mon\\\" being the Japanese for gate) was an outer castle gate, specifically the great southern main entrance to Kyoto during the Heian Period. It had massive pillars, towering archways and several chambers. The whole city of Kyoto, at the time of the story, was under civil unrest. People were hungry, even the Rashomon itself had become dilapidated for lack of proper maintenance. In the upper chamber thereof was dumped the city's dead, the victims of the prevailing hunger and violence.|In the lower chamber sits a servant who had just lost his job. He is said to be waiting for the rain to stop but he knows that even if the rain stops he really has nowhere to go and nothing to do. He had come to the dreadful conclusion that he would either die of starvation or survive by being a thief.|The mood is somber, the descriptive prose is elegant, fluid and spontaneous. Just like Murakami (in his short stories). Then the servant sees something...Thereafter comes one event after another which felt like Murakami's earthquakes, with a similar ending that leaves unanswered questions.|In the Introduction to the life and works of Akutagawa a Japanese literary critic, in 1917, described him (Akutagawa) as \\\"a writer who can't write without props.\\\" I was amused by this because elsewhere in goodreads before, discussing Kafka on the Shore with a Murakami fanatic K.D., I wrote that Murakami had used a lot of juvenile, ineffective props here (like talking cats, mother and son fucking, eels falling down from the sky, etc.) which were not even original as you can see parallels from Greek mythology and even in works of Lewis Carroll. |The Introduction also declared:|\\\"Sheer technique...though skillfully applied, does not necessarily translate into original literature. A fictional world that was not truly (the author's) own and that used borrowed containers would eventually reach and impasse and come to stand in his way like a high wall. Further pursuit of fictional method could only yield technical polish. And not surprisingly, the novelty would wear thin and readers would tire of seeing the same devices.\\\"|Wow, I myself could have said this after reading Kafka on the Shore! Now, guess who wrote this introduction? Close your eyes and bang your head on the wall--Haruki Murakami himself.|LOL! In his (undated ... perhaps 2006?) introduction, Haruki Murakami gives us what he thinks would be Japan's 10 most important \\\"writers of national stature\\\". They are writers that \\\"left us works of the first rank that vividly reflect the mentality of the Japanese people ... [the works] must have the power to survive at least a quarter century after the writer's death. ... The important thing is whether each of them as an individual human being embraced an awareness of the great questions of the age, accepted his or her social responsibility as an artist on the front line, and made an honest effort to shape his or her life accordingly.\\\"|Haruki believes the top 10 to be:|#1. |S\\u014dseki Natsume|. Equal #2 are: 2.|Akutagawa Ry\\u016bnosuke|, 2.|\\u014cgai Mori|, 4.|Shimazaki To son|, 5.|Shiga Naoya|, 6.|Jun'ichir\\u014d Tanizaki|, 7.|Yasunari Kawabata|. Equal #8 are: 8.|Osamu Dazai|, 8.|Yukio Mishima|.|He can't think of a tenth name for the list(!). Which is cute if you are a fan of |Kenzabur\\u014d \\u014ce|. Haruki is such a bitch. He goes on to say that \\\"Kawabata's works, to be honest, have always been a problem for me. ... I have never been able to identify very closely with his fictional world.\\\" And \\\"With reagrd to Shimazaki and Shiga, I can only say that I have no particular interest in them ... what I have read has left little trace in my memory.\\\"|So old Kenzaburo has been excluded from Haruki's list of 10 ... which only includes 9 ... and of which, 3 he really doesn't have time for? Ouch.|But Haruki's obviously mad. He seems to say that |Botchan| can be \\\"memorized whole by most school children\\\". What?|On to Akutagawa ... I liked the \\\"I\\\" stuff the best. [3.25 stars]|Akutagawa's short stories are so engaging, and his use of words is very thoughtful. Some of them are very humorous, and the others havs poignant social messages. |Haruki Murakami, who wrote an introduction for this book, says, |\\\"The flow of his language is the best feature of Akutagawa's style. Never stagnant, it moves along like a living thing. His choice of words is intuitive, natural-and beautiful.\\\"|The titular story, Rash\\u014dmon, is an exquisite work which shows how morality could be at odds with the need for survival. It is very profound. |Other stories which I liked include:|\\u2022\\\"The Bamboo Grove\\\" (which I'd read and reviewed separately much earlier)|\\u2022\\\"The Nose\\\", a satire on public perception of one's appearance |\\u2022\\\"The Hell Screen\\\", a shocking story about a painter who goes insane in the process of finishing his magnum opus (a piece showcasing what hell would be like) and allows his innocent daughter to be set on flames in order to further the realistic nature of his art. |\\\"I could have sworn that the man's eyes were no longer watching his daughter dying in agony, that instead the gorgeous colors of flames and the sight of a woman suffering in them were giving him joy beyond measure.\\\"|\\u2022\\\"Dr. Ogata Ry\\u014dsai: Memorandum\\\" and \\\"O-Gin\\\" showed the early days of Christianity in Japan, and how followers of that sect were at odds with the other people around them and with the hostile government, as their faith is challenged at every turn. These were very interesting to read. |\\u2022\\\"The Story of a Head That Fell Off\\\" is a Chinese story depicting the horrors of war, and the people who fight those wars. |\\\"Xiao-er was overcome by a mysterious loneliness such as he had never experienced before. The vast blue sky hung above him in silence. People had no choice but to go on living their pitiful lives beneath that sky, buffeted by the winds that blow down from above. What loneliness! And how strange, he thought, that he had never known this loneliness until now.\\\"|\\u2022\\\"Horse Legs\\\" is arguably the most humorous story in this collection. It has a sardonic and tongue-in-cheek tone throughout. A newspaper article that comes out after the protagonist goes mad and runs away from home states, |\\\" What we would like to ask, however, is not \\\"What is the name of Mr. Oshino's malady?\\\" but rather \\\"What is Mr. Oshino's responsibility to his wife?\\\" Like an unblemished golden jar, our glorious National Essence stands upon a foundation of belief in the family. We need not ask, then, how grave the responsibilities of the head of any one family might be. Does the head of a family have the right to go mad any time he feels like it? To this question we must offer a resounding \\\"No!\\\" |Imagine what would happen if the husbands of the world suddenly acquired the right to go mad. All, without exception, would leave their families behind for a happy life of song on the road, or wandering over hill and dale, or being kept well fed and clothed in an insane asylum. Then our 1,000-year-old belief in the family \\u2014 our very pride in the eyes of the world \\u2014 could not fail to collapse. We are not, of course, urging that Mr. Oshino be treated harshly. We must, however, loudly beat the drum to condemn his rash crime of having gone mad. No, let this not be limited to Mr. Oshino's crime alone. We must also condemn the utter misfeasance of successive administrations for having neglected our urgent need for a law prohibiting insanity.\\\"|I did not enjoy the supposed autobiographical section called \\\"Akutagawa's Own Story\\\" as much as I did his fiction. They had their moments, but were overall quite tedious to read.|Daidoji Shinsuke explores his childhood and school, with the narrator being a self-proclaimed intellectual. \\\"Death Register\\\" talks about his estranged, insane mother, an elder sister he never got to know, and his father who relinquished him as a baby. \\\"The Life of a Stupid Man,\\\" and \\\"Spinning Gears\\\" both show Akutagawa probing the meaning of the life he has led to that point, and moving ever closer to death. |* |Notes for myself|\\u2022 |Akutagawa's mental illnesses and their impact on his work|\\\"We will never know for certain whether the neuroses from which he suffered later in life were caused by hereditary factors, mental instability, or his latent fears, but sickness of mind casts a heavy shadow on the late stories and would end up taking his life. Surely it would be no exaggeration to say that writing these late works effectively shortened his life, but it is also true that he was unable to find a way to go on living as a writer without writing works of this nature-and once he could no longer live as a writer, his life would cease to have meaning. It well could be that Akutagawa had to turn to the world of storytelling and technique in order to find refuge from his dark heredity. Rather than face the real world, so full of terror and pain, he might have transported himself mind and body into another world in hopes of finding a kind of salvation in its fictionality.\\\"|\\u2022|Akutagawa's position in Japanese literary history, as given by Murakami| \\\"Perhaps the true reason that Akutagawa Ryunosuke continues to be read and admired today as a \\\"national writer\\\" lies in this in the realization and determination that effectively pushed him into a dead end. He started out as one of the chosen few: a Japanese intellectual with a consciousness torn between the West and Japan's traditional culture, in the border regions of which he succeeded in erecting a uniquely vigorous world of story. As he matured, he attempted to fuse the two different cultures inside himself at a higher level. He attempted structurally to combine the distinctively Japanese style of the I-novel with his own elegant fictional method. He hoped, in other words, to pioneer a newer, more uniquely Japanese form of serious literature. But this would have required a strenuous, long-term effort that his hypersensitive nerves and delicate con- stitution could not sustain. Pursued by the dark visions that crawled out of the gloom, he would finally despair and cut his life short. Akutagawa's terrible suicide administered a great shock to the minds of his contemporaries. It signaled both the defeat of a member of the intellectual elite and a major turning point in history.|Many Japanese would see in the death of this one writer the triumph, the aestheticism, the anguish, and the unavoidable downfall of the Taish\\u014d Period's cultivated elite. His individual declaration of defeat also became a signpost on the road of history leading to the tragedy of the Second World War. In the period just before and after his death, the flower of democracy that had bloomed with such promise in the Taisho Period simply shriveled and died. Soon the boots of the military would resound everywhere. The writer Akutagawa Ryunosuke stands as an illuminating presence in the history of Japanese literature, a symbol of his age's brief glory and quiet defeat.\\\"|\\u2022|The role of a writer in the contemporary globalized world|\\\"Today, when the world is growing ever smaller through the spectacular development of the Internet and the increasingly rapid flow of economic interchange, we find ourselves in a pressing situation whereby, like it or not, our very survival depends on our ability to exchange cultural methodologies on an equivalent basis. To turn toward a stance of national exclusivity, regionalism, or fundamentalism in which nations become isolated politically, economically, culturally, or religiously could bring about unimaginable dangers on a worldwide scale. If only in that sense, we novelists and other creative individuals must simultaneously broadcast our cultural messages outward and be flexible receptors of what comes to us from abroad. Even as we unwaveringly preserve our own identity, we must exchange that which can be exchanged and understand that which can be mutually understood. Our role is perfectly clear.\\\" It\\u2019s hard to review something like Ry\\u016bnosuke Akutagawa\\u2019s | Rash\\u014dmon and Seventeen Other Stories|: it\\u2019s too complex, too often inducing a |\\u201cWhat was that I read?\\u201d|, too deep, and yet approachable, very readable. |I found this book by chance while surfing Goodreads, and was immediately attracted by | Rash\\u014dmon|, since I am a fan of Kurosawa\\u2019s, and am all admiration for that particular film (the plot of which, ironically, draws more from Akutagawa\\u2019s |In the Bamboo Grove| than it does from | Rash\\u014dmon| itself). I bought the book and told myself that I\\u2019d read it slowly, one short story at a time\\u2014and found myself caught like a fly in a spider\\u2019s web. I ended up reading most of this book in long stretches, until my eyes hurt. |The eighteen stories are very diverse in nature: there are ghosts here, and dragons. There is hell, both somewhat distant, seen through the benevolent eyes of the Sakyamuni in |The Spider Thread|, |and| close, horrifying, macabre\\u2014as in |Hell Screen|. There are tales of a Japan torn between tradition and modernity, of battles between Christianity and older, local beliefs. There are battles, too, between man and man, and\\u2014most forcibly, most searingly, the stories of man\\u2019s battles with himself. The latter are brought most vividly (and disturbingly) to life in the last section of the book, which brings together six autobiographical stories by Akutagawa. |As I progressed through this book, I went through a range of emotions. I laughed at the quirky humour in |The Nose, Dragon: The Old Potter\\u2019s Tale| and |Green Onions|. I shivered at the cruelty of |Hell Screen|. And I couldn\\u2019t help but wonder how much of |Spinning Gears| (which was published posthumously, after Akutagawa killed himself in 1927) was real, and how much was not. |This is a brilliant book. It\\u2019s rich, textured, detailed. The imagery is often breathtaking (\\u201c|She had a radiant face, like the morning sun on a thin sheet of ice\\u201d|), and the layers are fascinating, peeling away from the mundane, even comical, to the wryly profound. As an example: |\\u201dHe put a cigarette in his mouth and was striking a match when he collapsed face-down on his desk and died. It was a truly disappointing way to die.

In addition, there\\u2019s a brief but good biography of Akutagawa, and a superb introduction by Haruki Murakami. I would advise reading all of these, besides the stories that comprise the book: they help get a better insight into the author, and so add to the experience. |I ended this book feeling both oddly deflated |and| inspired. As a writer, I can\\u2019t help but be inspired by writing of such stature. As a writer, too, I can\\u2019t help but feel that I cannot possibly ever write as brilliantly as this. Not a book I am going to forget in a hurry, if ever.  I first came by Ry\\u016bnosuke Akutagawa via Akira Kurosawa\\u2019s 1950 film |Rash\\u014dmon|. It\\u2019s an adaptation of two short stories within this collection: \\u201cIn a Bamboo Grove\\u201d and \\u201cRash\\u014dmon\\u201d (though Kurosawa adapted the former and simply took the name of the latter and used it as a framing device). It\\u2019s one of my favorite Kurosawa films, and so I knew I\\u2019d like to check out the source material at some point. I\\u2019m glad I did, because there are some really good stories here and it\\u2019s an overall well-rounded anthology.|This collection is divided into four sections: A World in Decay, Under the Sword, Modern Tragicomedy, and Akutagawa's Own Story. Akutagawa crosses genres throughout these stories--from comedy to drama to autobiography to Jidaigeki to the Gothic--and a lot of them work out quite well. I\\u2019m a particular fan of \\u201cIn a Bamboo Grove,\\u201d \\u201cHell Screen,\\u201d \\u201cThe Nose,\\u201d \\u201cThe Spider Thread,\\u201d and \\u201cGreen Onions.\\u201d The autobiographical stories in the last section, while at times quite fascinating in learning about Akutagawa\\u2019s inner turmoil, don\\u2019t read as well as the previous stories; they\\u2019re interesting and informational, but they\\u2019re ultimately a little hard to get into and not as entertaining as the previous stories.|Akutagawa is a great writer. He oftentimes has some slick and inviting prose, which makes for easy and enjoyable reading. His well-placed comedic touches were surprising too. However, if you aren\\u2019t that educated on Japanese history and geography, like me, then you may struggle a bit with the references. There are extremely helpful note indications throughout, but that means flipping to the back of the book, which does disrupt the flow of reading. I\\u2019d definitely recommend this collection, but some might want to proceed with caution. This collection of short stories had no discernable connection or theme throughout. The stories were pretty different: some were fantastical/fairytale-like, with spirits and gods etc.; others were realistic historical fiction. The realistic ones were also pretty varied: some featured real historical figures, like poets, artists and politicians; others were populated by completely fictional characters. Some were set in ancient times, some in medieval, some in XVII, XVIII, XIX centuries. |Jumping between these entirely different tones and settings felt jarring|.|There were a |few stories I thought were brilliant|, moving or enjoyable. One of them, in particular, was about |Matsuo Bash\\u014d|, made me want to pick up a collection of his haikus. |But for at least a |half of the book or more, I was bored and struggled| through unknown words, things and concepts, spirits and historical figures which carried no meaning for me, character/plot arcs that I didn't get.\",\n          \"I had a predisposition to like this, as I enjoy Sir Walter Scott, and I also read and enjoyed Maturin's \\\"Melmoth the Wanderer\\\" some years ago. In fact, this was such enjoyable escapism that I think I got more pleasure from it than any other book I've read this year so far. It helps that I have always felt more at home in the 13th century than the 21st. This is a magnificent blend of Gothic fantasy: battles, jousts, sieges, damsels in distress, wise hermits, evil witches, corrupt ecclesiastics - even werewolves...with plenty of comedy to leaven the horror, and some bromance to leaven the courtly love of knights for maidens. Some of the physical description, such as of the bandit castle by the sea, left me vertiginously intoxicated. I was there, torchlight flickering as I climbed the stone spiral staircase, damp exhalations from the dungeons beneath, looking out over the battlements on a wild and stormy sea under the star crossed sky...|Are there faults? Only if you dislike this sort of thing. If you know nothing of the historical background, are not familiar with the Bible, and have no Latin, then it would be very confusing. One of the comic themes is the relationship between two worldly prelates, the battle-axe-wielding Bishop of Toulouse and the wine-bibbing Abbot of Normoutier. The bishop's disdain for the latter is founded on the Abbot's frequent mangling of his Latin quips and descent into \\\"dog\\\" Latin. I think I missed a lot of the wittier and more abstruse puns, but then as a schoolboy my Latin compositions were often disfigured by my Latin master drawing a lamppost in the margin of my exercise book, signifying that my efforts were mere \\\"dog\\\" Latin themselves. |Nevertheless this is a tightly plotted page-turner and I was sorry when it came to an end.

It is fast-paced, sweet-tempered, open-hearted, a golden book in many ways \\u2013 a paean to youth, to a future brimming with possibility, to a present that is lived vibrantly and joyfully. It is also about selling out, junkies, prostitution, and race wars. How can this be? I suppose it is all about point of view, and the protagonist\\u2019s perspective is the embodiment of Live Now and Love It. This is one of those rare novels that make the reader feel even more alive by reading it. The enthusiasm of its narrator was equaled by my enthusiasm of the world that MacInnes plunges us into headfirst. It depicts, it mocks, it leaps forward, it grabs your hand and carries you along.|I was young once, gosh, just a decade or so ago. I lived a life full of punks, hippies, goths, ravers, djs, fags, dykes, trans girls & guys, straight guys who made out with other guys and straight girls who were angry and ardent feminists, vegetarians and vegans, girls who stripped for cash in dives and guys who waved their hard-ons for free in print, fighters and peacemakers, guys who carved symbols on their bodies and girls who dressed like vampire princesses; we lived in junked-out flats filled with too many people, we shared clothes and went on road trips and had neverending parties and made protests against the government and danced all night and consumed amazing amounts of booze and drugs and sex and live music. I read Absolute Beginners during that period, and one of the best things about this novel was that it felt completely real and true to me, despite the difference in social scenes that were separated by decades, by an ocean. It showed the true diversity available to people in their late teens, in their 20s; it illustrated \\u2013 and so nonchalantly \\u2013 values that were not just held dear, but were unspoken, values that defied the middle class and that were simply assumed to be shared by everyone we knew. To read oneself and one\\u2019s peers in a novel written in 1958 is something special, something wonderfully moving to contemplate, even many years later.|What lifts Absolute Beginners above the idea that life for the young and unencumbered can be a great time, a fun carnival, is its complete awareness that this is also rather an illusion, and a crushingly temporary one at that. So many wonderful things can happen, so much excitement \\u2013 and yet the world around this world still exists to be fought against. For me and my friends, that world to rail against did not just include asshole yuppies who came to our neighborhoods from time to time, it included police brutality, the WTO, the wars abroad. In Absolute Beginners, that world above includes race warfare. \\\"Race\\\" is clearly interwoven throughout the narrative, and yet it is one of so many things that the narrator is aware of, just one facet of the world that the narrator comments on... the reader could almost lose sight of it. But race and racism are there the entire time and slowly but surely become the whole point; by the end, the reader and the protagonist see how fragile a life full of living can be when the world is singling out his peers for destruction, and those peers are turning to him for alliance. The protagonist chooses, and chooses well. But it marks an ending of sorts, an ending of an attitude and a lifestyle, and the beginning of an understanding that no matter what he and his peers have built, he lives in the world still, as does everyone, and that world is one of both wonder and horror. One of the reasons I picked up |Absolute Beginners| again was because of historian Dominic Sandbrook's daft grudge against Colin Macinnes (in | |Never Had It So Good| |). I last attempted it in my teens. It had been a slowish read \\u2013 proved to be the same this time round \\u2013 and was easy to give up on back then because the library copy was a horrible mouldy one. |Now, the vintage atmosphere and detail in the story was way more interesting so I hung around to savour that (when younger I'd filed this era as being 'before anything was cool'), noticing differences from the film musical, and processing the late 1950s slang. Plenty of 60s slang is still immediately familiar yet this stuff from only 5-10 years earlier, not immortalised in pop culture, can require a moment's thought to work out. These characters are the cool kids of my parents' generation, yet they are so different it reminded me how facile the idea of generation=social attitude can be. (One of the good points Sandbrook makes is that most people of this era, even the younger ones, weren't mods, hippies or their rock 'n' roll precursors, they were hardworking squares.) |There's something artificial about the way the main character loves the term \\u201cteenager\\u201d (as beloved of the media then as \\u201chipster\\u201d has been for the last few years, though back then there was more fear and real disapproval, rather than the contemporary eye-rolling). He likes defining what it means to be a teenager \\u2013 it's a culture at least as much as an age, squares aren't really teenagers \\u2013 and it's not that different from The Who's 'My Generation', by the time of whose release the narrator and his mates might (if they weren't still pop-culture purveyors) be boring oldsters. The over-consciousness of cultural definitions works in a way because he's one of those entrepreneurial kids who's interested in talking to the media and getting noticed by the movers and shakers (in an 80s or 90s setting he'd be a DJ / party planner, here he's a photographer, proto-|Blow-Up|) but it's also a reminder that |Absolute Beginners| was written by a champagne socialist easily old enough to be the protagonist's dad. Some of the press evidently loved it (a quote on the back from |Harpers & Queen| says \\\"Prose as sharp as a pair of Italian slacks and vivid as a pair of pink socks\\\", |The Sunday Times|: \\\"The cult novel of the year.\\\"). But I'd love to know what the real teenagers of the day thought of this book... Was everything in it so five years ago by the time they ever saw a copy? (By the 80s, presumably re-reviewing in the light of the film, the |NME| says \\\"Macinnes caught it first - and best\\\"; and Paul Weller, just born when it was published, \\\"a book of inspiration.\\\")|Some reviewers are critical of the way black, Jewish or gay people are described by the narrator. There's an element of positive stereotyping, complimentary or neutral description with frequent reference to some of the narrator's friends' background (how lively a friend's Jewish household is compared with his English one, there are white girls who fancy black men apparently because of sexual stereotypes, that sort of thing). But they have personalities too, and the narrator is way more inclusive and accepting than most of his contemporaries, even prepared to get injured defending his mates during the Notting Hill race riots. His way of speaking is what, over decades, evolved into the contemporary attitudes that mean it isn't okay to say the same things now. Such critics tend to dislike arguments for historical context, but if ever there was a good one for those people cutting a text some slack, it's with this book. |I'm kind of surprised to see so many reviews on here, and quite good ones, for |Absolute Beginners|; I'd had the impression its reputation was fading. Seems that inclusion in |1001 Books To Read Before You Die| has boosted it a bit. For my part I'd recommend it mostly for people interested in the social & cultural history, and for those who like some background to their vintage clothes/film/music habit.  A rather entertaining novel which evokes the emerging youth culture in Great Britain in the 1950s. An unnamed 18-year-old story teller searches for his own way in life, but obviously wrestles with the classic social conventions. The last quarter the book is more a description of the growing minority problem, including racial riots. The city of London shines through the book, and the author clearly shows his love for that city. Of course, this radiates the atmosphere of the times it was published (1959), with quite a few pages full of slang, but at the same time it has something refreshing. A plus also is the engaging style of MacInnis, with some razor-edge dialogues. Fun! Controversial. Interesting!|And you get to have the Bowie song in your head the entire time.

A good read and did well to portray the time and place but not the classic I was expecting. Definitely worth a read though. To be honest, this book was more interesting to me for its historical value than for anything contained in the story. Absolute Beginners' narrator felt like something of a dull archetype \\u2013 the arrogant late-teenager convinced he knows more than those around him, and unaware of his own failings. | Perhaps it was more of a novelty in 1958, when it was written. Which brings me to what I thought was most intriguing about the novel. To me at least, it read for all the world like the anachronistic work of someone writing in much more recent times about how they would have imagined the late 1950s to be. The passing references to running like Dr Roger Bannister or driving away from a riot like Fangio could so easily have been clumsy attempts to remind the reader that the story is taking place in a particular historical setting. But more than that, the anti-racist politics of the latter part of the novel, set against the background of the 1958 Notting Hill race riots, read to me like a modern liberal's wish fulfilment of what a white liberal kid in the late 50s might have made of it (though such an author would probably have refrained from having his narrator use the term 'Spade' to describe the black characters. MacInnes was, in this respect at least ahead of his time. Perhaps the more remarkable for the fact that he was already about the same age as the narrator's father and maybe this goes some way to explain another of the book's oddities \\u2013 the narrator's idiolect and use of slang terms I've never really encountered anywhere else. Not being old enough to judge myself, I might be doing MacInnes a disservice, but I couldn't help thinking of Anthony Burgess' made up youth argot from A Clockwork Orange. An moderately interesting diversion, which I'd picked up after hearing Andy Miller praising it on Little Atoms, but nothing more. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this. It's the first book of the year and the first book I had to read for this semester of university (for my post-1945 literature class) and it definitely sets the tone for a good year of reading.|It was way funnier than I expected and I really enjoyed the episodic element of the story. We basically follow the main character who is a young photograph in 1958's London through 4 different days in 4 different months of the year. The main character's narrative voice is very unique and it reminded me a lot of Alex from the Clockwork Orange in the sense that both characters invent their own slang and language through which they see and describe their world. The book is divided in four parts and every part is focused on one day. Even though at first the story seems to be a simple romance, it progressively gets more and more complicated as the author is getting closer to the events of the Notting Hill race riots in September of 1958. There is a strong element of diversity in the characters, we have black people, Indians, homosexuals, lesbians and more. MacInnes really strives to inform the reader of his time and bring to him a new understanding of the culture of these minorities, different from the way they were represented in the media.  A long summer in the London of the late fifties is the setting, as the nameless eighteen year old protagonist makes his living taking pornographic photographs in the few gaps in his hectic social life spent on his Vespa and in the coffee bars and jazz clubs. As the months pass he experiences friendship, betrayal, love and death with a motley cast of friends known by their nicknames, jobs or fashion sense; the deranged Wizard, the rentboy the Fabulous Hoplite, Mr Cool, the Misery Kid, Crepe Suzette and Ed the Ted. |There is the semblance of a plot, but this is driven by its protagonist, in whose character the reader is soon engrossed by, a teenager full of innocence looking at injustices around him, and deciding to act; particularly with regard to race, and the riots of the time. |Its about growing up, becoming wiser and yet remaining young and fearless, looking sharper and staying one step ahead of the crowd.|The book is rich in social history, with some wonderful descriptions of the city and the jazz of the day. As the 60s approach its the birth of the Mod scene, and quite inspirational.  I always had a soft spot for Julien Temple's film |Absolute Beginners|. I guess it was a bit overly ambitious to make a modern musical based on a 1958 novella, but I am grateful for the attempt. It produced a beautiful soundtrack featuring songs from Smiley Culture and the Style Council; wonderful vignettes from David Bowie (tap-dancing across a giant typewriter), Ray Davies, and Sade; and an opening sequence of black and white photographs from 1950s London which are nostalgic and heartbreaking to watch. And where did he get that great opening shot of Piccadilly Circus?!|I guess that's the real attraction of the book. It's an ode to a city that the narrator loves so much, it nearly breaks his heart. Colin MacInnes is keenly aware that he is writing about a time that is already in the past, that is already gone, that he already feels the ache of loss for. Basho might sum it up as \\\"Sitting in London, I miss London.\\\" The city as we imagine it isn't the reality and maybe that's what it means to be a teenager: that process of discovering that how you think the world should be isn't what it actually is. With that lesson, this is a coming-of-age novel in the spirit of Catcher in the Rye -- the love of place and childhood innocence that inevitably slips away.|The movie, for a musical, did capture a lot more in the book than I would have expected, but it certainly borrowed most heavily from the first and last chapters: meeting all of the narrator's Soho characters and the 1958 riots: setting and plot, and some rather slick dialogue. But being a musical, the movie is a bit shallow in character. The novel gives us two middle chapters which the movie largely ignores, but gives readers an insight into the inner thoughts and feelings of the narrator. The relationship of the narrator to his family and his father in particular is deeply touching. Despite the narrator's apathetic attitude to anything of seriousness and his dismissive attitude toward old-timers, past and present catches up with him.|This book has a special place in my heart and always will. I adore meeting all the characters in the narrator's life, and 1958 London certainly looks wild and fun, but the author's injection of pathos gives this cult novel an authenticity that makes it universal. (Although, I still feel I need a hip chat dictionary.) |Bonus takeaway: Hipsters seem even more derivative after this novel. On the plus side I could still remember whole scenes from this work although it has been at least twenty years since I last read it. The negative is that it hasn't aged well. It rings as true as a lead pound coin. The author's attempt to approximate working class and youth cultural speech is cringe worthy and patronising. The reality was that McInnes was from a middle-class background and grew up in pre-war colonial Australia long before the concept of the teenager as an entity existed. He vacillates between regurgitating media reports about the teenage phenomenon and preaching liberal-left propaganda. The cast of stereotypical characters are moved around a cardboard cut-out set reminiscent of an Edwardian child's toy theatre. As Colin points out to his older brother,|\\u2018In those days, it seems, you were just an overgrown boy, or an under-grown man, life didn\\u2019t seem to cater anything whatever else between.\\u2019|His generation, however, were not just following their parents or becoming father or mother clones. They were the first adolescent group to have money, their own clothes, and the first adolescent group to consider themselves \\u2018teenagers\\u2019. They were starting out from scratch, making it up as the went along. They weren\\u2019t just beginners in the world of adults. They were absolute beginners.| I am sure that the plot is that great or the ending that satisfying, but the whole thing is so vibrant that it just carried me along. I loved it.  Back in 1999 I watched a film called Quadrophenia, in which depicts the life of a mod: The clothes he buys, the music he listens to, the love for Vespas and the constant showdowns with rockers. I thought it was quite original ( I knew it was based of a rock opera) Now that I have read Absolute beginners I am certain that this book was clearly an influence.|The plot is about the life of a mod. It also focuses on the lifestyle. However, it is much more than that. For starters there are a lot of passages about the freedom that youth brings and how older generations do not understand them. The main character is a jazz loving 19 year old, just ready to enter his twenties and we get his views on how society looks in his eyes, the absolute beginners being the name he calls his generation. I guess one could call this book an early YA novel.|Absolute Beginners is a love letter to London: but not only the romantic aspect. Like Last Exit to Brooklyn, Macinnes mentions people who usually do not feature in books. Thus we get portrayals of drug addicts, black communities and the London gay scene. The final section on the book is a loose commentary on the immigrants which entered London during that time.|Did I like the book? Although I found it interesting, I didn\\u2019t gel with the narration style plus I did find it overlong, the first section could have easily been shorter. I do know that the book has an ardent following and is somewhat a cult classic. Lately I've been into mid-century books narrated by teenagers. While I was traveling in London a couple of weeks ago, I started reading |Absolute Beginners| about 1958 Notting Hill in the run-up to the race riots. Now I'm reading Jos\\u00e9 Agust\\u00edn's |La Tumba|, which was published in 1964 and follows a rebellious, literary teenager as he attempts to navigate the stiff, adult world of 1960s Mexico City. |I realized why I'm finding these books appealing when I watched the |recent documentary on JD Salinger|, author of perhaps the most famous midcentury book narrated by a teenager, |The Catcher in the Rye|. All teenagers feel alienated from adult society \\u2014 mostly because they refuse to succumb to the phoniness of it all. In order to become successful in life, you must accept a level of phoniness. You must learn to refrain from expressing certain opinions. You must master the art of sycophancy and tactical deference. Adult social interaction is, |in the words of Irving Goffman|, \\\"theatrical performance.\\\" |But teenagers aren't yet invested enough in their careers or communities to succumb to the phoniness. And so, refreshingly, they rebel against it. Teenage protagonists of novels are so appealing because, despite their insecurity and inexperience, they are authentic. They allow us to engage in the fantasy of doing and saying what we merely think because we're afraid of upset the theatrical performance of polite society.|Throughout my week in London, I became increasingly attached to the nameless, teenage narrator. |Absolute Beginners| is the British equivalent of beatnik literature. But instead of depicting the jeans-and-t-shirt-wearing literary beats of the US, we're entreated to a ragtag cast of |mods| and |teddy boys|, the two rival youth subcultures of post-war London. The novel depicts youth culture in London through the eyes of a precocious, empathetic teenager in the run-up to the |1958 Notting Hill race riots|. |The book is great social documentary of London's complicated multicultural coming of age through the eyes of a narrator's personal coming of age. It's also excellent fiction with a Kerouac-like unorthodoxy of prose. If you're interested in learning more about the 1958 race riots, BBC as a good |overview|, and |Stasy Adams| and |Nick Bentley| have written academic pieces on MacInnes's portrayal of 1950s London in his fiction. \\u201cNow, you can think what you like about the art of jazz \\u2013 quite frankly, I don\\u2019t really care what you think, because jazz is a thing so wonderful that if anybody doesn\\u2019t rave about it, all you can feel for them is pity: not that I\\u2019m making out I really understand it all \\u2013 I mean, certain LPs leave me speechless.\\u201d |\\u2015 Absolute Beginners|Colin MacInnes' novel \\\"Absolute Beginners\\\" (1959) is a wide-lens view of pre-Beatlemania London, with characters, images and ideas that remain pop fixtures: stylish, jazz-loving Mods; leather-clad, rock-loving Teddy Boys; the ascendancy of the teenager with increased income and diminished responsibility; and an atmosphere of combustible youth culture reacting to WWII-era morals.|\\\"Absolute Beginners\\\" is a remarkable period artifact for those reasons alone, but its literary qualities will surprise many readers looking for the cult novel that profoundly influenced Paul Weller. MacInnes' novel is energetic, lyrical and often brilliantly written. With its combination of cynical, stylized observation and dreamlike panoramas, \\\"Absolute Beginners\\\" feels like J.D. Salinger's \\\"Catcher in the Rye\\\" crossed with C\\u00e9line's \\\"Journey to the End of the Night\\\" and \\\"Death on the Installment Plan.\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0|The novel is less a plotted tale than a shifting, mildly surreal journey across London and its outskirts. Divided into four chapters, each section captures the events of a single day over separate months in 1958. The unnamed 18-year old narrator creates the impression of a \\\"Lord of the Flies\\\" social experiment in reverse, where teenagers have created a separate, superior civilization of freedom and literate sophistication. Living independently as a photographer in a diverse West End neighborhood, he encounters a range of colorful characters: the \\\"ponce\\\" (pimp) Wiz, the biracial Mr. Cool, the lesbian Big Jill, the violent and illiterate Ed the Ted, and his unrequited love \\\"Cr\\u00eape\\\" Suzette. The key conflicts are the threat of a race riot, the narrator's complex love for Suzette, whom he finds in a mariage blanc with an older man, and the sad expectation that youth's fleeting, ecstatic moment will soon fade.|With its unremitting imagery and stylized wordplay, \\\"Absolute Beginners\\\" is probably best read in a short immersive burst where its unique atmosphere can be savored before its novelty fades. Readers willing to surrender to its rhythms will discover an oblique, charged reality, a dreamily evocative Swinging London of the mind. Julien Temple's 1986 musical film adaptation, more \\\"Newsies\\\" than C\\u00e9line, suggests the challenges of filming MacInnes' vision. The participation of David Bowie and Ray Davies confirms its lasting influence, but it remains a unique, unrepeatable artifact. I had to take some time to organise my thoughts on this. It's difficult to assess exactly what I think of a book that is so firmly set in and attached to a particular time and place. A further problem is that the time is a couple of decades before I was born and the place is the opposite side of the country. As a result, I have no idea if the events or the narration of |Absolute Beginners| are in any way authentic. I also don't really care. The narration really reminded me of Anthony Burgess's |A Clockwork Orange|, not only because both books are narrated by disaffected youths but because there's also a similar rhythm and feel to it.|I found the first half of the book less interesting than the last. While I enjoyed bouncing around the London mod scene, particularly the nicknames and commentary on the other characters, I never felt very invested in the narrator's on/off relationship with Suze and really didn't feel that there was much tension in it. The sections I enjoyed the most were the home visits with his family and the race riots that conclude the story. I felt that his conversations with his mother and father really showed the generational disconnect without being overly dramatic or cliched. Both the family and race riot sections are when the prose comes out of the setting and moves onto more universal themes. |The race riot deserves its own special paragraph. This is the part of the book that I felt was truly great. The simmering tension that we feel before things start to get violent conjured up images from Spike Lee's masterful |Do the Right Thing|. Again we see themes and issues raised that are as relevant today as they've ever been. In particular, the way that racial tensions are exploited by tabloid media. Although the media featured here is print, today's TV news is every bit as bad and the tabloids are still what they've always been. The government and police are also criticised for their ineffectiveness, either through a lack of will or a lack of ability. The more things change... It\\u2019s London in 1958, and the narrator of Colin MacInnes\\u2019s novel is living in what seems to be a new-minted teenage paradise, where teens, for the first time, have money to spend and the freedom to spend. It\\u2019s a world where all races, creeds and levels of society mix, a world where the (never named) narrator feels totally at home \\u2014 the only cloud on the horizon being that the love of his love, Suze, has agreed to marry her homosexual boss as a front (homosexuality being illegal at the time). The narrator spends most of the first half of the book wandering round London, talking to Teddy boys, pimps, TV personalities, pop stars, jazz cats, fellow teens and advertising executives \\u2014 they all seem to know him, and many owe him a favour or two. Everything\\u2019s looking up.|But, no, it isn\\u2019t. 1958 was the year of some infamous race riots, and MacInnes\\u2019s narrator lives right in the middle of where they\\u2019re brewing. Also, his dad may be dying.|It\\u2019s a novel that seeks to capture the brave new world of its time, when life for its young narrator seems full of nothing but possibility, only to be suddenly dashed as he becomes thoroughly disgusted with the intolerance, violence, and sheer complacency his fellow human beings are capable of. It\\u2019s written in a rather odd style \\u2014 I\\u2019m not sure if teenagers actually spoke in this peculiar mix of mock-formality and jazz-like improvisation (it reminded me most of all of Anthony Burgess\\u2019s invented patois for |A Clockwork Orange|).

A slice of life shot through with bursts of teenage outrage and human compassion. Nice and short, too. I started reading this novel with bad intentions. I wanted to laugh at it. For some reason I assumed it was going to be corny, poorly written and absurdly naive... As it happens, it |does| contain some language that has dated in such a way that it brings a smile to the lips of the modern reader, but it's simply not possible to read this book right through with an ironic smirk. It's just too good, too exuberant, too smart, too accomplished, and the issues it raises are acutely appropriate for our own age.|The single quality about it that impressed me the most is the relative sophistication of the narrator in the essential political, cultural and social aspects of London life. Bear in mind that this is the 1950s. The narrator's attitudes are more advanced than those of the average person that I remember in my childhood back in the 1970s; and his style is a damn sight sharper. This book has changed my view of what life was like in '50s Britain. It wasn't |necessarily| all grey and bland... I wanted to read Absolute Beginners because of its ties to the development of Mod culture. I was expecting to get a glimpse into late 1950s British youth culture, but the book explores a whole lot more than that. I found the first 10 pages or so a little hard going until I got my head around the rhythm of the speech patterns, but once I was used to it and sorted out a few of the slang words it made for easy reading. |The first person narration really gives you a really personal look into the life of a main character with a very distinctive voice in quite a unique time culturally. At the same time MacInnes deftly weaves the bigger social issues of race, class, and sexual orientation into this very personal story, not unlike the way Christopher Isherwood captured 1930s Germany in his Berlin Novels.|Absolute Beginner's is not only a fascinating look into 1950s British youth culture, but British culture as whole just before the dawn of the far more documented 1960s. An interesting, thought provoking, witty novel set in London in 1958 and written in the first person from the perspective of an eighteen year old white teenage boy. He is a free lance photographer living in an apartment block. He is very social, mixing with a variety of individuals. He describes the smoky jazz clubs of Soho, the coffee bars of Notting Hill, his relationships with his girlfriend Suzette, his mother, father, siblings and friends.|I found the last fifty pages of the novel particularly interesting as he vividly describes the beginnings of the Notting Hill racial disturbances / riots from the perspective of a white teenager.|A worthwhile, rewarding reading experience. This book was first published in 1959. From BBC Radio 4 - Book at Bedtime:|Colin MacInnes's cult classic about teenagers, style and racial tension in 1950s London A lively story and thought-provoking at times. The copious slang reminded me of A Clockwork Orange. I rate it a four-minus.  This is the second book I read for the books1001 LiveJournal book club community. It was not one I would have picked up to read on my own, and probably wouldn't otherwise have finished even if I did start reading it. The reason is that I found the language difficult to follow, being full of slang and dialect that I am unfamiliar with. Also, after the first hundred pages or so, I realized that nothing was really going to happen. This book is more a portrait of a lifestyle, or of a generation, than a plotty story. Yes, there are some story arcs and character development, but they do not really generate a sense of tension or movement in the book. |Having said that, I was deeply impressed by the author's style of writing, by his use of vocabulary and image-building. I felt that I was there, in London of the 1950s, and was completely infected by the malaise, helplessness, yet hopefulness of the main character and his acquaintances. |======|And here is the more extensive review I posted on books1001:|Title: Absolute Beginners|Author: Colin MacInnes|Publication date: First published 1959, this edition re-issued 1986 by Penguin Books|# of pages: 226|Source: Bought used through Amazon.de (3 Euros + 3 Euros shipping)|Summary/Back of the book: It was the fag-end of a London summer in the fifties and change simmered below the surface... The young and the restless -- the Absolute Beginners -- were busy creating a new world of cool music, coffee bars and freer love, as different from Mrs Dale and traditional England's green and pleasant land as they dared to make it. Sharp, pungent, filled with the dreams and danger of city life, Absolute Beginners is now a brilliant film.|My review: The Great Gatsby, meet After Hours (1985 Scorsese film). Briefly: This is a book I wouldn't have picked up on my own, but I feel enriched after having read it.|There's not much plot: An 18-year-old Londoner who makes a living taking pornographic photographs wanders around the city, meeting up with various movers, shakers, pimps, prostitutes, and representatives of pretty much every disadvantaged and advantaged minority of his acquaintance. There are Jews, blacks, and Sikhs, lesbians and gays, white supremacists, gang bangers, television personalities, newspapermen and -women, socialites, songwriters, a diplomat, half-siblings, dysfunctional family members, an advertising executive, and lots and lots of jazz aficionados. And of course the requisite love interest, who is unhappily married to a gay man old enough to be her father.|The book consists mainly of the protagonist (who is never named) bouncing from one encounter to the next, partly driven by his need to hustle up some business and partly through sheer chance and the fact that he seems to know everyone who's anyone, and most of the people who aren't as well. The only loose plot threads that I could pick out were our boy's puppy-love pursuit of Suzette, and the slowly building racial conflict that explodes in the last section. I don't want to make it seem like the book is about race or class conflict, though; at least it didn't come across that way to me. It was more (again, to me at least) about the disconnection and rootlessness of the post-war generation.|There is so much that could be analyzed in this book, but I'll just touch on one point which I think illustrates this underlying theme. That is the lack of names for the characters. Not only the narrator, but many of his acquaintances are only referred to by various nicknames such as The Wizard, Call-me-Cobber, the ex-Deb, and Mr Cool. It is as if the narrator has rejected the names (and thus the roles) assigned to them by their parents, as representatives of the previous generation, and they are re-inventing themselves, or seeking their own identities and by doing so, re-defining the world itself.|Moving on to the other main point I wanted to discuss, I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with the style in which this book was written. This is the love part:|\\\"Up out in Pimlico, the old, old city raised her bashed grey head again, like she was ashamed of her modern daughter down by the river, and I went up the streets of dark purple and vomit green, all set at angles like ham sandwiches...\\\"|The imagery is pure poetry, and never degrades into cliche. I was mesmerized by the descriptions, and surprised time and again by the new and imaginative ways in which the author put words together to create an emotional impression.|But this is the hate part: |'And why, Ed,' I said, 'have you moved darn ear?'|'Cos me Ma as,' he said. 'She's bin re-owsed.'| |I find reading dialect tiresome, and especially as an American, it's difficult to figure out.|or:|And straining up the Portobello road, I passed a crocodile of infants, and among them a number of little Spadelets, and I noticed, not for the first time, how, in the underground movement of the juveniles, they hadn't been educated up yet to the colour thing.|This is an example of the pervasiveness of slang expressions; it took me a long time to eventually realize that 'Spades' are blacks. I still don't know what is meant here by 'a crocodile of infants'. This lack of understanding the vocabulary really interfered with the flow of the narrative for me.|(Side note: This book was made into a movie in 1986, which was a commercial flop. I would have liked to order the DVD as well, but I wasn't sure if it would play on my DVD player. Also, according to the Wiki entry, the story was changed quite a bit for the movie. You may have heard the David Bowie song of the same title, written as the theme song for this movie. It hit #2 on the U.K. charts.)|If you're looking for action-packed adventure or a heartfelt love story that will make you weep, this isn't the place to find it. But if you're looking for top-notch writing, deep thoughts packaged in entertaining and engaging characters, and a portrait of a generation that is both timeless and inextricably bound up in its setting, you should get a copy of this book and set aside an afternoon (it's a fairly quick read) to read it. I loved this book for its energy, its youthfulness, its optimism and its realism. Reading it made me feel like a teenager again - populated as it is with young people who were England's first ever teenagers (and doing far more with their youth than I ever did with mine). The distrust of adults and the scepticism of their austere rules creates a bubble in which young people move, with a freedom adults resent. |And of course, it just goes to show that the same arguments come round again and again. The Notting Hill race riots of 1958 were one more example of scapegoating minorities, and the narrator (author) is a refreshingly liberal voice from the era in the same way young people today are more accepting of difference and change. The unnamed narrator may use pejorative terms like 'Spade' and 'Poof', but he likes black people and gay people, and he sees no reason why what makes them different to the white straight majority should stop everyone getting along.|It's also an unromantic love letter to London. |So many great passages from the book that if I started quoting I'd never stop. I understand Absolute Beginners is one of three books by MacInnes themed on London and black culture in the 50s, and I'll get around to reading the other two some day. |(Despite being a massive Bowie fan I've never seen the film, but from what I know of it I can see how hard it must have been to capture the book's implicit wonder at being alive in any film starring Patsy Kensit.)|(Oh! But the theme song from the film is great.) After I got a little bit into this book, with its outdated slang and its theme of youth rebellion and after glancing at the copyright page -- it first came out in 1959 -- I realized, \\\"Ah, this is the British response to 'On the Road.'\\\" England is a smaller country, of course, so instead of tooling across the North American continent in search of wigged out jazz musicians and so on, the characters are taking cabs between Soho and Notting Hill to listen to some skiffle in a pub. And instead of Dean Moriarty's metaphysical yearning for a lost father, the main character stops in to visit his dad at his flat in Pimlico. Fair enough; there are still the junkies and queers. But even so, I started to notice something wrong: the slang, even given the trans-Atlantic differences, seemed a bit tone-deaf, and the characters spent too much time actually TALKING about the generation gap and \\\"teenagers\\\" instead of just showing what the generation was about. Then I noticed that MacInnes was born in 1914. What? Someone who was born before the Great War is trying to write a definitive novel about what it's like to be a teenager on the eve of the 1960s? It must have seemed revolutionary at the time, but now that people have their social history sorted out a little better, this novel doesn't quite work, even though Anthony Burgess actually called it one of the 100 must-reads of the 20th century, or something like that. Second in a trilogy. I'll give the other two a pass. Hugely enjoyable and a reminder that teenagers were not a construct of the 1960s. This is London in '58 - a mass of kids with attitude and cash, throwing off the shackles of post-war austerity and indulging in drink, drugs, casual sex and jazz. Everything that the oldsters hold dear is rejected, everything is new and fresh and has to have a new cool name (\\\"Fabulous Hoplite\\\" and the \\\"Ex-Deb-of-Last-Year\\\"). Our narrator is a teenage photographer out for kicks, a proper Londoner who can barely bring himself to move out of his manor and nothing gets him more than the friction between the indiginous brainless youth (The Teds) and the coloured immigrant labour (constantly and I'm afraid probably authentically called \\\"spades\\\"). Everything is in ferment - black against white, old against young, big ideas in the smallness of their world. A bible of late fifties cool. I love this book. I read it at that special time when I was a teenager as with Catcher in the Rye when these two novels meant the world to me because I could identify with the main characters. I am certain that if I first read them as an adult I would not hold these two books so dear. Nostalgia is a great thing.|I think Absolute Beginners suffered in popularity because of the 1986 film, as I recall they left out my favourite character The Great Hopite and I didn't care for all the Jazz hand/pointy toed pirouette dancey bits that were not in the book. It was definitely a cool trendy book to read before the film and now no one talks about it much which is a shame because it is a great book. Mysteriously out of print for many years, this classic novel of teenage life in fifties and sixties London charts the late and largely unlamented cafe bar culture of the period, full of sharp suits and casual violence. Despite being slightly dated, in particular due to its outdated terminology, the book evokes the period in expert fashion. It is chiefly memorable for its depiction of early immigration into Britain from Africa and the Caribbean. Made into a by all accounts lamentable film featuring Patsy Kensit.\",\n          \"If I had to describe this book in one sentence - little stories that magically contain big and excitingly complex ideas. |Writers aren't evaluated in the context of history as stringently as artists are. There are artists alive now who can paint with the technical bravura of the likes of Tintoretto or Titian but no one, understandably, is interested in their work. I suppose this conundrum was most famously demonstrated by the Dutch forger Van Meegeren who resented the fact that the art world showed no interest in his dated derivative work and so forged Vermeer paintings as if it's technical skill alone that distinguishes genius. Recently I read some of the books by William Trevor and you could say he too, like Van Meegeren was a forger. He appropriated the distinctive style of past masters - and yet, as if the past had never happened, he receives the acclaim no painter doing the same thing would get. What I'm getting at is that if you put Akutagawa in the context of history it's remarkable how innovative and pioneering these stories are, especially considering many were written before Calvino was even born (the writer Akutagawa most reminds me of some ways) and before Katherine Mansfield was being credited for evolving the possibilities of the short story. (How I wish she had read him!) Put him in the context of history and Akutagawa is a marvel. Not that he isn't a marvel whatever way you look at him.| Stand outs are his unreliable narrators in Rashomon where eye witnesses to a mysterious death all give conflicting accounts of what happened. Dragon: The Old Potter's Tale where a ridiculed monk with a big nose as revenge posts a notice declaring the dragon of the lake will ascend to heaven on the third day of the third month. Much to his amazement a massive crowd gathers on that day. Here, as DeLillo would be years later, Akutagawa is fascinated by the pull and power of the crowd. Red Onions where a young girl living from hand to mouth in a bedsit goes out on her first date and is suitably lit up by romantic expectation but discovers the highlight of the evening are the cheap red onions she stumbles upon (Akutagawa doesn't hold romantic aspiration in high esteem!) And finally the last autobiographical story where the narrator is plagued by a concatenation of disarming synchronicities which gives you an idea why Akutagawa was to kill himself soon after. |Brilliantly fresh and compelling from start to finish.  It is probably not very rare when an extremely gifted person emerges on this planet. But it is rare when this person manages to absorb the influences of many cultures and produce a very original innovative syntheses in his short life. The whole body of work that transcends the national boundaries and would influence a way of writing for decades and even centuries. I know only three names in the 20th century Kafka, Borges and now, Akutagawa. Notably he was the first. What unites all these three, they were born either into the culture without long established national literary tradition or in the time of dramatic changes of the society and literature. I would leave Kafka aside. But both Borges and Akutagawa were immersed in many different languages and cultures since their childhood. Borges has read even Don Quixote in English. Akutagawa was reading both Japanese and Chinese traditional literature as child but also hungrily absorbed almost 200 years of the Western literature by the age of 18.|My first encounter with Akutagawa was unsuccessful. While at university, I\\u2019ve picked up his collection of short stories and found them too stylised and boring. Now many years after, my view has changed almost to the opposite extreme. I can read him many times and never get bored. In fact, I absolutely admire the versatility of his gift. His variety of styles is exceptionally wide. And he was always experimenting with his method and searching for new techniques through his short life. He never was totally satisfied it seems. He changed the decorations and styles. But there is one thing which always present in his tales. It is authenticity of human feelings. It is also amazing how many writers he anticipated, including Kafka and Borges but even Knausgaard though it might sound incredible to start with. |I\\u2019ve read much bigger volume of his stories in Russian. Not that big part of his work has been translated into English. But I think this collection contains many of his best tales with a few notable exceptions. I would just pause on a few to underscore the versatility of his gift:|\\u201cRashomon\\u201d and \\u201cIn a Bamboo grove\\u201d. Those two are the most famous as they were the base of the movie by Kurosawa. But purely from the perspective of the literature, the second one stands out. Apparently it is the first time ever when a bunch of unreliable narrators are describing the same story from the different perspective, contradicting each other. And the single \\u201ctruth\\u201d is never revealed. Robert Browning apparently did something similar in |The Ring and the Book| but Akutagawa raised it to the totally different level with the open ending. Now we are so much get used to this tool. But even from the perspective of our century, this is the one of the most elegant and economically told stories of this type.|\\u201cHell Screen\\u201d - this is not a medieval tale. This is a philosophic investigation about the dominance of the high art over reality. Apparently Akutagawa visited an anatomy morgue to write this story.|\\u201cThe story of head fell off\\u201d - it is included here in a comical section, but there is nothing comical about this story. And the image of a deep blue sky getting closer and closer would stay with me for a long time.|\\u201cGreen onions\\u201d - this story I would not be surprised to find between early Chekhov tales. How our high expectations from life often end with the prose of the aforementioned vegetable.|\\u201cHorse legs\\u201d - purely from the land of Kafka.|There are a few of the notable omissions in this collection:|\\u201cThe Yam Gruel\\u201d is translated into English. It is included into |Rashomon and Other Stories|. It is a tale about the feeling of a \\u201clittle\\u201d person modelled on Gogol\\u2019s Overcoat. As far as I remember, Gogol\\u2019s character dies from the shock of loosing the overcoat. But Akutagawa has twisted the tale asking very different question: what if he would get what he dreams about? And there is no Akaki Akakievich. He has been replaced by a samurai.|\\u201cHandkerchief\\u201d - It is available in English as well. It is included into |Mandarins: Stories by Ry\\u016bnosuke Akutagawa|. The collection of the recently translated stories by Archipelago press. What a clever short story this is! On the surface it is about East-West and its mutual accommodation. But this is not a simple story. It is one of those tales like a matreshka doll. You\\u2019ve opened one not expecting to find another, but it is in there. And then - one more. And the smallest one does not look anything like the initial one and leaves you puzzled what was the story about really.|Now the section called \\u201cAkutagawa own story\\u201d. While reading the introduction in my Russian collection, I\\u2019ve learned a lot about the state of the Japanese literature at the time. Due to the Meji reformation and opening to the West, they tried to build up their modern literature by absorbing around 200 years of the Western Canon. Obviously they were loosing themselves in the process. Apparently they did not have a concept of a novel per se. So in 1885 Tsubouchi Sh\\u014dy\\u014d (1859-1935) a literary critic, translator of Western literature, and novelist formulated the principle for the Japanese fiction in his work\\u00a0Sh\\u014dsetsu Shinzui\\u00a0(The Essence of the Novel). He came to the conclusion that the descriptive realism should be the way to go. This has apparently helped to focus the minds of the Japanese writers. |Many of them has taken the idea even a step further following the theory that only object a person could know truthfully is her/himself. As a result they developed something called |\\\"I-novel\\\" (\\u79c1\\u5c0f\\u8aac, Shish\\u014dsetsu, Watakushi Sh\\u014dsetsu)| where a writer would describe both his mental and physical life in its daily details with the varied level of psychological depth. So the fashionable 21th century auto-fiction was in fact born in Japan about a century earlier. I was amazed to find that out. But why i am talking about it? Akutagawa initially considered it more or less as lazy and limiting exercise. But then, at some stage, in his last decade he has started to experiment with the method. At the same time he kept experimenting with the style, used huge range of framing devices from the letters to the dialogues and the sketchs of unwritten novels (the device later successfully used by Borges who loved Akutagawa's work). He also kept his psychological complexity in these stories. And his very last tales before his suicide are read more like impressionistic pieces full of terrible beauty rather than the confessional tales. |One serious omission form this part of this collection is \\u201cDialogue in darkness\\u201d, the story that is written as a conversation between Akutagawa and the angel or maybe he is the fallen angel who has become a devil. I\\u2019ve searched whether the story exists in English. But did not find anything conclusive. The story was published posthumously. And I wanted to finish with the quote from there:|D. You will very likely die soon.|Akutagawa: But that thing which has created me at the first place will create the second me.|And the \\u201csecond him\\u201d is the powerful and omnipresent influence in the world literature since. \\u201cIn fulfillment of his longstanding dream, he became the author of several books. But what he got in return was a desolate loneliness.\\u201d| |This collection offers a piercing insight into the stunning yet troubled mind of Ry\\u016bnosuke Akutagawa. A writer brought to the world by a madwoman, he was a well-known insomniac, a drug addict, a guilt-plagued sinner, yet he produced such beautiful works while hounded by the looming shadows of his inevitable insanity. |This masterwork can be adequately divided into three parts: the first part (A World in Decay & Under the Sword) are vivid myth-like stories set during the Heian, Kamakura, and other pre-war eras of Japan. From the titular story of an encounter under the Rash\\u014dmon (a gate built as a monument in the southern entrance of Kyoto) to the story of a painter who perfectly depicted the fury of hell into a screen, the first few stories present such beautiful and breath-taking pictures of early Japan in all its splendor with its unique culture and oriental beliefs in full display. |The second part (Modern Tragicomedy) are surrealistic stories set during Akutagawa\\u2019s lifetime towards the dusk of the Meija era and the early smoldering of the Taisho. These haunting yet humorous stories reflect the slowly decaying psyche of Akutagawa as his fears and nerves start to take hold of his pen. |And the last part (Akutagawa\\u2019s Own Story) are his final manuscripts towards the end of his life when all he could muster to craft were words formed by his horrors and his painful loneliness. In one of its few bright spots he writes, |\\u201cIn my savage joy, I felt as if I had no parents, no wife, no children, just the life that flowed forth from my pen.\\u201d| But these last few remnants of thought from this gifted storyteller evoke mostly the sorrowful darkness of a mind in despair whose only solace was literature. The different eras of Japan were his canvas, his brushstrokes his blood, wrung out unbearably, drop by drop, till he had none more to bleed.|\\u201cI don\\u2019t have the strength to keep writing this. To go on living with this feeling is painful beyond description. Isn\\u2019t there someone kind enough to strangle me in my sleep?\\u201d| |What initially was a beautiful and elegant collection morphed into an outpouring of literary agony towards the end. In this regard it is like a Chimera, a two-fold beast, formed by the fictional beauty of Akutagawa\\u2019s tales and the painful terrors of his grotesque reality. One night, I woke in the dark hours no longer able to sleep. After a while I accepted my semi-wakeful state and found my way to the sofa. There I settled under a blanket and flicked ideally through the TV channels, eventually I happened upon a film |Ghost Dog|, not apparently to be confused with |Moondog| | although to my mind ghost dogs and moondogs must be much of a muchness, no? |, anyway the film seemed to be pleasing pretentious and about right for being neither asleep nor awake but watching moving pictures on a screen. Two of the stories in this collection were made in to a film, but the powers of the night which decide our sleeping have so far not decreed that I must see that film in the early hours of a star lit morning so I haven't.|As it happened the film made mention of the story collection | Rashomon| which seemed to be of some importance to the title character and his philosophical stance and so when it came to pass that I was gripped, not by midnight wakefulness but by mid-afternoon book madness, I ordered it from the library and in time it came to me from Gravesend, so if you are in Gravesend it will be a couple of days before it is back with you - patience!|Akutagawa chronologically is approximately a contemporary of Katherine Mansfield, he also died young and was much concerned in his fiction with death and psychology, but unlike her at least based on the stories I've read, he has a broader range of story settings and is somewhat less interested in gender and romantic relationships. In this volume the stories range from the title story set in medieval Japan to the recent past to his own days in inter-war Japan. Both Mansfield and Akutagawa were fellow travellers in their modernism, attempting to capture the fleeting contact of human awareness of the moment and the fractured, unreliable perception of an individual.|Really these are stories one could read repeatedly and I recommend them warmly, despite the grimness of the autobiographical ones which twist around fears of madness and thoughts of suicide | which ultimately led to the end of the author's own life|.|Yes, Modernism, madness and death - everybody's favourites, I am plainly really going out of my way to encourage you to try these. So what can I say that is a bit more tempting? Dare I mention the wide range of styles, the sometimes uneasy mixture of the Japanese and the European? Akutagawa was a big fan of Dostoevsky and the fin de Siecle writers, indeed one story here may be a Japanesed version of Grushenka's Story of an Onion from |The Brothers Karamazov|, then again it could be, I suppose, a Buddhist folktale. There's also a lot of humour, in different registers, in one story a man in Manchuria suddenly finds he has horse's legs and we find that eventually nature is stronger than nurture, in another a waitress struggling to get by on romantic dreams and a low wage, might be about to be seduced by a man when she spots spring onions on sale at a bargain price. |So great variety and a glimpse into the troubled soul of another person, quite a lot in just over two hundred pages of extremely short short-stories. And there's more... an introduction by Haruki Murikami assesses Akutagawa in the context of a Japanese writer attempting to find his own voice while drawing upon both Japanese and European literary heritages; 'I love Dostoevsky and Strindberg and Flaubert and I am a discipline of Natsume Soseki'. Murikami holds that Akutagawa's literary dead end in trying to marry the traditions in himself led to his physically premature dead-end, in which case the introduction is a kind of meta-fiction and we can read all eighteen stories in the collection as nestled within it the multiple attempts of a prisoner to escape their unique cell. He tries historical settings, Chinese settings, contemporary settings, he draws on his life experience, his personal history as a adopted child is reflected in his divided literary heritage, so we are treated to a fireworks display of creativity, it has to stop of course, as all fireworks' displays must, but it is spectacular while it lasts.|The perfect example of Murikami's point is the story | On a Bamboo Grove| which places the reader in the position of an examining magistrate of early medieval Japan - we read a collection of testimonies relating to the discovery of a dead body in said bamboo grove. Are any of them true? Even taking the testimonies together and mentally reconstructing events is that the truth of what happens? Is there an objective truth beyond that a man who was once alive is now dead? For practical reasons in daily life in order to have a functioning legal system we pretend that this is so, but as a writer appealing to readers Akutagawa makes a different point, the same one maybe as he makes throughout all these stories even or particularly in the fictionalised ones based on his own life. For a person drunk on the film society culture prevalent in Kerala during the Seventies and Eighties, \\\"Rashomon\\\" is a magic word.|Akira Kurasowa\\u2019s film enjoys cult status among movie buffs. It is rivetting in its presentation of \\u201ctruth\\u201d in many layers, presented as a conversation among three people: a woodcutter, a priest and a commoner who take shelter under the ramshackle Rashomon city gates to escape a downpour. The story is the death (murder?) of a man, the rape (?) of a woman and the capture of a bandit responsible (?) for both: as the story unfolds, the differences in the widely varying testimonies of the people involved force us to have a rethink on what \\u201ctruth\\u201d means.|I had heard about this movie a lot before actually seeing it; and it lived up to its hype and more when I finally got around to seeing it. But this review is not about the movie. It is about the magical short story which was its inspiration \\u2013 and other stories like it, penned by one of the great figures of Japanese literatures, the turn-of-the-century novelist Ryunosuke Akutagawa.|When I first saw the movie, I was so taken up by the sheer visual beauty of Kurasowa\\u2019s storytelling that I did not ruminate much on what this movie was based on, even though I saw the \\u201cbased on\\u2026\\u201d title in the beginning. It was only after joining Goodreads that I came to know about this book, and was immediately hungry for it. Having read it, it has left me hungry for more by the same author, and Japanese literature in general. It is so shattering in its impact on the intellect, even in translation; I cannot imagine how powerful it must be in the original Japanaese \\u2013 for, as Haruki Murakami says in the introduction, the translation can never capture the power of the original.|Akutagawa is a tragic figure. His mother went mad shortly after his birth, and he was raised by his childless maternal uncle and aunt. Even though they were a highly cultured family and young Ryunosuke was lucky to have a childhood exposed to a lot of intellectual pleasures, he was constantly plagued by ill-health and bullying in school. His ill-health continued into youth: he suffered from chronic insomnia and fears of madness. The misfortunes of family and country also distressed his oversensitive soul to an inordinate extent. Until finally, on 24 July 1927, Ryunosuke Akutagawa committed suicide by an overdose of Veronal.|The author\\u2019s gifted and tortured soul is visible throughout this amazing collection of stories. It is divided into four sections: (1) A World in Decay, (2) Under the Sword, (3) Modern Tragicomedy and (4) Akutagawa\\u2019s Own Story. These sections correspond to four periods of Japanese history as well as four creative styles which took birth from Akutagawa\\u2019s fertile imagination.|In the first section, stories (most of them retelling of old legends) set in the Heian Period (A.C.E. 794 \\u2013 1185) are included. This was Japan\\u2019s classical era; a time of peace, prosperity and opulence when art and culture flourished. But as is common with most ancient kingdoms, it declined and power slipped from the hands of the aristocrats into the hands of the warlords. It is this twilight period that Akutagawa uses as a backdrop for his stories of degeneration and decay. The title story of the collection, Rashomon, encapsulates the entire misery of the country in the symbol of the gate of the capital city of Kyoto. The city having been struck by one calamity after another, the author says:|With the whole city in such turmoil, no one bothered to maintain the Rashomon. Foxes and badgers came to live in the dilapidated structure, and they were soon joined by thieves. Finally, it became the custom to abandon unclaimed corpses in the upper storey of the gate, which made the neighbourhood an eerie place that everyone avoided after the sun went down.|The stage is thus perfectly set for a set of disturbing stories. |Rashomon| narrates the story of a jobless servant who is sheltering from the rain inside the gate and an old woman, who steals hair from the corpses lying there to sell to wig-makers, justifying it by pointing out that the dead people were also thieves and cheaters. Ultimately, she inspires the servant to become a thief himself who starts off on his new career by stealing her clothes!|In a Bamboo Grove|, one of the most extraordinary stories ever written (this was the inspiration for Kurasowa\\u2019s film, even though he used the Rashomon gate as a symbol of the decay he was portraying) narrates story of a dead warrior, a thief and a raped woman from the viewpoint of each of the protagonists. Each of the stories is different and equally believable from the evidence available at the scene of the crime and the statements of the witnesses. Who we believe will depend a lot on who we are.|But the story which impressed me most in the whole volume is |Hell Screen|. This gem of a novelette gives us a taste of horror, Japanese style \\u2013 I could understand how movies like |Dark Water|, |The Ring| and |The Grudge| came into being. The tale of the deformed artist Yoshihide (nicknamed \\u201cMonkeyhide\\u201d because of his deformity), the tapestry of hell he paints for the Lord Horikawa, the artist\\u2019s daughter who is a serving girl at the Lord\\u2019s mansion and the pet monkey has all the elements of a medieval ghost story and a gothic romance. However, it is Akutagawa\\u2019s narrative style (whereby he leaves a lot unsaid) and his choice of the narrative voice (that of an unnamed member of the Lord\\u2019s retinue) that are masterful. The story is a one way ride into darkness.|In the second section, we move forward to the Tokugawa Shogunate (A.C.E. 1600 \\u2013 1868). This was the last feudal military government of Japan. During this period, the shogun elders of the Tokugawa clan ruled from Edo Castle. As Jay Rubin, the translator, says, the Tokugawa centralised feudalism \\u201cimposed the principle of joint responsibility on all parts of society, punishing whole families, entire villages, or professional guilds for the infractions of individual members. This fostered a culture based on mutual spying, which promoted a mentality of constant vigilance and self-censorship.\\u201d|In the story |Loyalty|, the disastrous effects of the madness of a samurai on an entire dynasty is described: in this merciless world, it does not mean just the destruction of a person, but of a whole bloodline. The other two stories included describe the clash between Christianity and Japan\\u2019s traditional religions. These distressing tales are rendered with much empathy and wit.|In the third section we find a sarcastic Akutagawa, full of black humour. |The Story of the Head that Fell Off| and |Horse Legs| use the trappings of fantasy to create a sort of darkly comic tale. In |Green Onions|, we can see an author smiling at himself and his fellow-scribes, in a pastiche of a romantic tale.|There is a whole tradition of autobiographical writing in Japan, called \\u201cI-Novels\\u201d, where the author\\u2019s life itself is fictionalised. Even though Akutagawa initially stayed away from this genre, he finally succumbed to peer and critic pressure and started writing such stories. It is here that one can see a fine mind finally unravelling. There are hints of this in the first three stories, especially in |The Writer\\u2019s Craft| where an author is forced write an elegy for somebody whom he barely knows; just on the strength of his writing talent. This sense of unease is increased in |Death Register| where he tabulates the demise of friends and relatives: and in |The Diary of a Stupid Man| and |Spinning Gears| (where Akutagawa keeps on hallucinating spinning gears on one side of his vision), we sense that we are standing on the edge of a minefield. (|Spinning Gears| was published posthumously.)|This is a well-chosen set of stories, with a fantastic introduction by Haruki Murakami. There are explanations about the historical periods, and background information on each story. The timeline of Akutagawa\\u2019s life is also provided. The book satisfies one, not only literally, but also as a window to Japanese literature.|Highly recommended.|Review also posted on my | |BLOG| |. Good, but...| Yes. I did it. I've committed one of the ultimate literary sacrileges of all time. I read Akutagawa Ryunosuke in translation when I could have read it in original Japanese. I am guilty as charged. I just couldn't resist a book with such a cool cover and Murakami's introduction |plus| his trusted Jay Rubin doing the translation. |Having said that, I did read it along with the actual Japanese text in front of me to see how well Jay Rubin has grappled with difficult early 19th-century Japanese and rendered it into English. And the result was somewhat disappointing. I think he does a good job translating Murakami's works, but here with Akutagawa, he pretty much butchers most of his early stories that take place in medieval Japan (which stories, by the way, are usually extolled as his masterpieces). The original Japanese is, of course, in medieval Japanese, and it is quite different from modern Japanese (but not as different as modern English to Chaucer's middle English). But Mr. Rubin sometimes translates conversations into highly colloquial English, and that just doesn't work with Akutagawa's early stories.|The Japanese language - still today and even more so back in the day - is a very |polite| language, which logically makes it a very |vague| language as well, where curse words don't really exist and you say things in a very roundabout way. And to render this into modern colloquial English is like equivalent to rendering Shakespeare into today's slang with an abundance of \\\"F\\\" and \\\"N\\\" and other such words. Now from a reader's point of view, Mr. Rubin's translation is very readable. Very. It could have, however, been a lot more conservative on the use of colloquialism and slang without compromising its readability. |For example, in one of the scenes, a lord tells his trusted servant to kill someone, and the original reads more or less, \\\"Kill that man, that Rin'emon,\\\" which Mr. Rubin translates as \\\"Kill that bastard!\\\" Alright. This does show the degree to which this guy is mad (in fact crazy), but I'm sorry, that just doesn't work. The word \\\"bastard\\\" is just way too much of a bad word for someone like a lord himself could utter (and I don't think there was an equivalent in medieval Japanese). I do recognize the difficulty since the Japanese here is very very subtle. The meaning is close to \\\"bastard,\\\" but a LOT less blatant than what the English word conveys. In many many instances Mr. Rubin resorts to colloquial English that sounds too jarring to a Japanese ear when compared to the subtle nuances and beauty of the original Japanese. But that's just me, who is fortunate enough to be able to read both Japanese and English with more or less equal fluency. So as far as the translation is concerned, hats off to Mr. Rubin for making Akutagawa's stories easily available for the English-speaking public, but as an artistic work, it could have done much better by avoiding too much colloquialism and using more formal (and even a bit archaic) English to better convey the original voice of the text.|W/r/t the stories, they are really good. I'd even say he's Japan's Chekhov. In fact, you could see an exotic blend of Kafka, Gogol, Chekhov, and even Dostoevsky at work behind these stories. My personal favorites are his famous \\\"Hell Screen\\\" (intense and just awesome), \\\"In the Bamboo Grove\\\" (Kurosawa's Rashomon is based on this), and \\\"Horse legs\\\" (which is very Kafkaesque and just funny). \\\"Loyalty\\\" is also excellent in terms of it psychological insights. Though I wasn't a big fan of his later, autobiographical stories, they were strangely engaging. It's just too bad that one of his most famous stories, \\\"Kappa,\\\" is not included in this collection. Overall, it's a good short anthology of Akutagawa's stories. I was Compelled to read this after loving Akira Kurosawa's classic film. Most of the stories are superb, with Akutagawa's prose full of such fluidity. He really catches you out with some beautiful quirks of description, sharp bouts of humour, and many revelations in a short space of time that it's no wonder he is considered one of Japan's greatest short-story writers.

About a third of these stories are easily knock-out 5-star fantastic. The other two-thirds I'd rate mostly 4 stars with a few 3 stars. All worth reading and in general I think this is probably a good intro to Akutagawa's work in that it contains a nice cross-section of his work from the earliest historical stories to his later primarily autobiographical stories.|I personally preferred the earlier stories which ranged from tales of Samurai warriors and Shoguns and stories of religious persecution when Christianity was making inroads in Japan to satyrical stories about unfortunates with big noses.* While the settings are completely foreign to me, the characters are people I know all too well. My favorite story being \\\"Hell Screen\\\" in which an egotistical painter is commissioned to paint a screen depicting the horrors of hell. In order to sketch the scenes, he puts his assistants through a myriad of tortures and all I'll add in an effort to not give too much away is that karma is a bitch! These early stories have an almost Victorian gothic creepiness to them but it's a bit more subtle and far more insidious in that it seems infinitely more real. And Akutagawa has a nice dollop of humor running throughout these early stories as well.|The later autobiographical stories in which he writes of his mother who went mad, of his infidelities and his fear of going mad himself and his increasing depression that led to his eventual suicide are painful to read in how human and easy to relate to they are. But having read Dazai's similarly themed autobiographical stories not too long ago, Akutagawa didn't have quite the gut punch that Dazai had for me. Akutagawa's story \\\"The Spinning Gears\\\" was the best of the autobiographical bunch for me. Throughout, he continues to have visions of gears that nearly block out his vision. Those of us who have the luxury to think about life beyond just worrying about food and shelter can probably all relate to this nightmare of the cogs of life just taking over. The horror element of his earlier stories definitely comes into play here.|There's a slightly strange intro to this collection by Haruki Murakami which is far more critical of Akutagawa's work than I might have expected though it did seem like a relatively fair critique. I'm glad I read it after reading the stories though.|-----------------------|*When I studied Chinese, my teachers were all native Chinese, mostly on exchange and when we learned the word for \\\"nose\\\" we also learned that Americans are frequently called \\\"big nose\\\" so I had a good chuckle seeing that the Japanese are equally amused by big noses. I always think I don't enjoy short story collections. There're sometimes one or two short stories that I find interesting but others often merge into the formless forgettable mass (unless it's Alice Munro and then there are none). Then I encounter a collection like this and start doubting my preconceived ideas about my relationship with the form. |This was a fascinating collection. Starting with Akutagawa's take on the old stories and ending with closely autobiographical confessions of the paranoid depressed macabre mind. |Akutagawa is very well-versed in the western literature, he's particularly attracted to the psychological novels of the 19th century. I can see Poe's eerie influence in \\\"Hell screen\\\" story (one of my favorite retellings of the old tales), I also see Gogol in \\\"Horse legs\\\". And then there's the heartbreaking cycle of autobiographical stories of unravelling mind. He is lonely, perturbed, obsessed with death, self-doubting and struggling with inferiority complex regarding his skills, continually calling himself an idiot. This is an anxious, ill mind you're uncomfortable to spend time in, not gonna lie. (the last two stories are published posthumously after he killed himself, the second story was left unfinished, his brain just gave up on concentration needed to finish a story)|All in all, a very interesting collection I recommend to everybody: first stories to lovers of myths and fables; and the last stories to lovers of psychological. What I love about Rashomon is that it signifies pretentious snobbery so perfectly. Like, if you want to impress someone at a cocktail party, \\\"I didn't understand truth until I saw Rashomon,\\\" you might say. Did I say impress? I meant impress upon them that you would be super boring to go on a date with. You can win any argument by nominating Rashomon because no real people have actually seen it.|Anyway, I haven't seen it.|I read the book though! Here it is! No, not the one called Rashomon. That's actually about something totally different. Rashomon the movie was mostly based on a different story by this same guy, called \\\"In a Bamboo Grove.\\\" I know this from |reading the introduction.| Would you like to go on a date with me and I'll tell you about a pretentious movie I haven't even seen.|What book do you think is the Rashomon of books? Like, how could you instantly signify that you're pretentious? Is it Proust?|Things You Can Signify With Books|On The Road:| I will not be good in bed.|Jane Austen:| I haven't read a classic since high school.|Ulysses:| oh, this is probably the pretentious one. |What's your idea? Tell me - YOU RIGHT THERE, I demand that you tell me a book and what it signifies when a person claims to be a big fan of it.|Whatever, here's the thing, those are both wonderful stories but who cares when you've got something called HELL SCREEN coming your way.|HELL SCREEN|*heavy metal music*|Hell Screen is so fucking great, it's this Poe / Wilde / Faust thing where an artist can only paint from life and then he's asked to paint hell and you can pretty much see where this is going. There's a monkey.|Akutagawa is one of Japan's most famous writers. He wrote mostly short stories like these here. He committed suicide in 1927 when he was 35, overdosing on sleeping meds across the room from his wife and kids. All of the stories I read in this collection were perfect. Look, it's not that HELL SCREEN is the best name for anything ever and any story not called HELL SCREEN is stupid, but...it's not not that, either.  Akutagawa known as the |\\u201cFather of Japanese short stories\\u201d| stays true to his designation with this collection of metaphysically refined stories. The rendered stories: - The Grove, Yam Gruel, Rashomon, Martyr to name a few; highlights Akutagawa\\u2019s preference for macabre themes of immortality, depression, virtue, chaos and death. These stories encompass a constant battle of skepticism prevailing over virtue of morality v/s existence of evil.| | In Rashomon, the act of the ghoulish old woman picking out long hairs from the skulls of the corpses to make wigs and sell them to buy scraps of food delineate a desperate act to fulfill the demonic perils of life. Similarly, 'Martyr' highlights the thriving soul of hypocrisy in religion and the susceptibility to strong gossip.| | Akutagawa\\u2019s affinity for such themes brings out his real tumultuous relation with mental anxiety and clinical neurotic dwelling of his personal life. (He committed suicide at the age of 35 due to an overdose of Vernol). Furthermore, his description of kimonos/garbs adorning his protagonists illustrates a high usage of the color blue which in Japanese culture is the color of naivety,immaturity and youth.|  First read in 2007|In his characteristically measured, conversational introduction to this book, Murakami Haruki tells us that Akutagawa is his third favourite author in the modern (post 1868) Japanese canon (after Soseki and Tanizaki). Rather than giddily enthusing about the author, Murakami carefully contextualises him in Japanese literature and culture. Akutagawa lived during a brief period of prosperity and political liberalism between WWI and the Depression in 1929, and combined appreciative immersion in Japanese cultural life with passion for Western literature. He called Soseki 'The Master', and worked as an editor as well as writing; the autobiographical stories in this collection demonstrate the literariness of his short life.|As well as drawing on his own daily experience and mental anguish for source material (a form related to the 'I-novel' style of some of his contemporaries in Japanese literature), Akutagawa wrote stories set in the Edo period when Japan was governed by military overlords. Many of these have interesting historical content. He also wrote stories of his own time, with an amusing self-awareness. The writer is always a presence, even if only in the pleasurable excess of musical names.|His style is clear, lyrical and pierced here and there by vivid images, like the purple sparks made by the tram on the overhead wires that the narrator wants to hold in his hands. Murakami says 'the flow of his language... moves along like a living thing', and this translation by Jay Rubin certainly preserves this natural, dynamic, unforced quality. |One technique that I particularly liked and that is original or at least unusual is the one he employs in 'Hell Screen' as well as other pieces, that of using a disapproving narrator to tell the hero's story. This device not only actively engages the reader's sympathy with the protagonists, but also creates a deep and nuanced impression of social exclusion and isolation. \\u201cThe cable was still sending sharp sparks into the air. He could think of nothing in life that he especially desired, but those purple sparks\\u2014those wildly-blooming flowers of fire\\u2014he would trade his life for the chance to hold them in his hands.\\u201d|I came upon a review comparing Akutagawa\\u2019s writing to \\u201cshoots of flame visible through the snow\\u201d (quoting a Mishima story), which is very apt. Akutagawa\\u2019s writing burns with a lurid glow\\u2014well suited to his macabre sense of humor. Less so in the later stories in this collection, with his fear of madness, and his thoughts of suicide (which he would eventually commit), and his misgivings about living a life of literature. DNF @ 39%|These stories are not bad but I just can't muster any real enthusiasm for them.|It is not helped by the stories being unconneced and by themselves not being great examples of the short story format.|Of course, they were not written as short stories in the Western literary sense. It's just that the way they are written is boring me stiff.|Maybe I'll pick this up again at a later date, but right now, this is not working for me. Akutagawa is one of my favorite writers. He took his own life with barbiturates at age 35 and left behind some 300 stories, sketches, articles and literary experiments. In English he has appeared in over a dozen collections of the same 20-30 most famous stories retranslated a dozen times. This latest collection, translated by the consummate Jay Rubin, has a lovingly detailed introduction by the inimitable Haruki Murakami. It is a mere sampling of 18 stories from his impossibly good body of work. Unlike Toson, Soseki and Tanizaki, Akutagawa did not embark on massive literary projects. Instead, he honed his craft with precision and an appreciation for classic storytelling. I have read some of his stories ten times, and they always elicit a strong response from me. |In a lot of ways, he resembles Gogol, and even composed an homage with his story \\\"The Nose.\\\" Though different in content, the tone is reminiscent of the Russian master. This is one of the masterpieces contained in this treasury. The others include: \\\"Rashomon, In a Bamboo Grove, Hell Screen, Spinning Gears, Death Register, and the Life of a Stupid Man.\\\" Even the ones that are not masterworks per se, are extremely entertaining. \\\"Green Onions, The Story of the Head that Fell Off, Horse Legs, and Loyalty\\\" fall into this category. If you are new to this author, you may not enjoy all of his tales, but I believe you will appreciate many aspects of his singular talent.|He writes a few different types of stories: 1). retellings of classic tales from Chinese and other sources. These read a little like fables. 2.) Autobiographical tales: these are often depressing, taking details of his haunted life and casting them bleakly against the backdrop of his times. 3). Religious tales like \\\"Christ of Nanking\\\" (not included in the collection) and others. Historical tales, taking place well before the author's time but possessing uncanny verisimilitude.|In his stories you will find traces of his influences: Anatole France, Strindberg, Merimee, Goethe, Nagoya Shiga, Soseki, Toson, Tanizaki, Basho, Doppo, Ogai, Pu Songling and dozens of other European and Chinese authors. He has rewritten stories from Pu Songling's collections as well as retold many from the seminal Japanese proto-mythologies.|Akutagawa draws from Buddhism, Shintoism, Christianity and Myth. I think he is one of the most interesting writers I have ever encountered because he processes other literary worlds into new forms. Even when he waxes esoteric, he is charming and insightful. He explores human nature with deep characters and memorable comedy and tragedy.|This brilliant edition includes thorough notes by Rubin explaining the finer points of the stories. There is enough material in this singular Penguin edition to write a dissertation on Akutagawa. Jay Rubin has put in an astounding effort toward accuracy and illumination. I only wish he would continue with further volumes of stories.|If you appreciate the stories of Chekhov, Gogol, Maupassant, and Dostoyevsky, you will find a lot to love about this author. Typically, you can expect tortured artists, explorations of morality and death, futility and hope, love and loss. Very classic themes. \\\"Green Onions\\\" and \\\"O-gin\\\" were odd but welcome selections for this book. Overall, it is the most well-rounded collection of the author's writings in English.|I have so far discovered 107 Akutagawa tales in English. I've read every anthology of Japanese literature, every collection of his tales and tracked down out of print Japanese-American periodicals through JSTOR. I want to thank Ryan C. K. Choi and N. A. Feathers for publishing new translations of his work on their websites. This incredible author has not gotten a full treatment in English and I implore translators to get to work on making his complete works available. So far we have only about 900 pages of stories, when obscure, ancient masters like Pu Songling have been translated more comprehensively. Along with this collection you will want to read two more collections: Mandarins, translated by Charles de Wolf, and The Beautiful and Grotesque, which includes \\\"Kappa,\\\" his novella.|Though Akutagawa's accomplishment is profoundly important (far more so, I would argue, than Murakami claims in his indicting introduction), one wonders what heights Akutagawa might have reached had he endured the agonies of his intellectual rigors for decades longer. Was he capable of writing novels? Were the demons he wrote about in \\\"Spinning Gears\\\" exaggerated or as sincerely recorded as in Strindberg's Inferno? These questions will never be answered. But part of his appeal is how digestible and varied his work is.|This is undoubtedly one of the greatest short story collections by any Japanese or non-Western author. Throughout my life I've been experiencing the strangest tendency when reading a really great literary work: after finishing a particularly brilliant passage/story/poem, I just have to put the book down for while, to stop reading it altogether as if I was afraid that this was the peak and nothing better will follow. Sometimes this takes days of sweet pondering upon the writer's craft. I like savouring these moments, they occur rarely, bringing me much pleasure and gently nudging me into thinking about beauty. Many Akutagawa's short stories gave me this feeling, especially those that were about medieval Japan and the samurai (especially |In a Bamboo Grove|, |Hell Screen| or |Loyalty|). I find it extremely hard to comment on such brilliantly crafted small literary worlds. It's always difficult to describe perfection, you just have to experience it and then you know: this is |it|. I feel the compliments are also in order for Jay Rubin, the translator, who rendered these stories so beautifully into English.|On the other hand, this book seemed utterly depressing to me. Akutagawa is preoccupied with death and suicide in quite an unhealthy manner, which is surely due to his mental illness. Naturally, this issue is a fact of life, not a bad thing in itself, but the way this volume is compiled and filled with incredibly elaborate commentary on the autobiographical element of his writing, one sort of feels like sinking into that utter darkness with the author (the most dismal posthumously published stories are ordered in the end of this compilation). Thus, Akutagawa would be one of those artists that I put into a special category of mine - the writers that I consider truly gifted (if not even genius), but for various reasons I can't relate to them personally. |His own works were unlikely to appeal to people who were not like him and had not lived a life like this| ...as Akutagawa wrote himself. He tells us later that he is the one that believes in the existence of darkness only, not in the light. It leaves me just wondering how much of this is the result his depression or unhappy personal circumstances and how much the influence of fin-de-si\\u00e8cle literature he was devouring, an influence on his life that is duly acknowledged. |So, there he is - a master of words, a strange man... I guess this is the black and the white of this reading experience. A damn intense reading experience. Pre-review:| to tell the truth, the reason why I finally got my lazy butt up to seriously read contemporary Japanese literature (aside from the usual reads of Haruki Murakami, Yukio Mishima, Rampo Edogawa and all the other Japanese crime and mystery good stuff etc) is this: the |Bungo Stray Dogs manga seriess| LOL| | |Early this mornin', when you knocked upon my door|Early this mornin', ooh, when you knocked upon my door|And I said, \\\"Hello, Satan, I believe it's time to go\\\"|Me and the devil, was walkin' side by side|Me and the devil, ooh, was walkin' side by side|-Me and the Devil Blues-|Robert Johnson| | |(1) So far I am still in the Introduction part, but an introduction written by Haruki Murakami is definitely worth reading, for example, the part he commented as a novelist that Akutagawa's use of language is 'sharp and beautiful', the way he analysed another artist's works, his personal history and faimly history and the historical background! And it doesn't surprise me that he compares Akutagawa with Fitzgerald! (the short essay Murakami had written about Fitzgerald is beautiful as well). |(2) The Nose is an interesting case study of human emotions of shame, pity, self-image and malice.|(3) the fact that Rashomon is among Akutagawa's first short stories is quite impressive, and in Chinese we still use the term 'Rashomon effect' a lot. LOL|(4) When I was re-reading |The Spider Spread| and |Hell Screen|, I feel a sense of despair: Heaven is too far away but Hell and its darkness is hot on everyone's heels.|(5) But somehow I think the movie adaptation of 'Rashomon' (actually the movie is the mixture of the short stories |'Rashomon'| and |'In a Bamboo Grove'|) is a bit more impressive than its novel counterpart.|More to come. \\\"Rashomon\\\" tells the story of a \\\"lowly servant\\\" sheltering from the rain on the steps of a rashomon (outer castle gate). He has recently been laid off and sits pondering his future. He hears a sound and ventures inside the rashomon to see what it was. Inside are heaps of dead bodies from the recent plague and a strange old woman wandering about, going through the corpses' clothes. The servant attacks the old woman, strips her of her clothing, throws her onto the heap, and runs off. |\\\"In a Bamboo Grove\\\" features a married couple and a robber. The story is told from the perspective of all witnesses and it emerges that the husband was murdered but who did it and why is the mystery. |These are the two most famous Akutagawa stories and are an excellent start to the collection. However, afterwards they become quite mediocre and even a bit tedious. The forced gothic of \\\"Hell Screen\\\" plods along until a near hysterical ending that undermines the seriousness of the story, that of obssession and the artistic mind. \\\"The Nose\\\" is a very odd story about a priest with a very big nose, has it shortened, and it grows back again. It's one of those \\\"be grateful for what you have, accept who you are\\\" type tales and not nearly as brilliant as Gogol's \\\"The Nose\\\" (Gogol being one of Akutagawa's influences and, frankly, a better short story writer). |As the title suggests there are 18 stories here but those are the only ones I can remember. The last couple in the section called \\\"Akutagawa's Own Story\\\" are interesting, with \\\"Life of a Stupid Man\\\" playing with form and presenting an interesting take on autobiography through small snippets of a life glimpsed in passing. \\\"Spinning Gears\\\" is the final story he wrote before his suicide (pills) and is about the slowly disintegrating mind of Akutagawa. The desperation and mounting paranoia give the reader an insight into Akutagawa's fragile and fractured mindset. The strange imagery is also fascinating. The spinning gears he sees around his eyes confuse and scare him while at every turn he sees signs of death - a decaying animal corpse, dying people in hospitals, and above all his morbid fear of going insane like his mother. |I won't say I didn't enjoy the book as there were some stories here that were excellent, and whether it's Jay Rubin's translation or not, the writing was always of a high standard. And students of literature will find reading \\\"Rashomon\\\" and \\\"In a Bamboo Grove\\\" very rewarding as will film students who are interested in the work of Kurasawa who based his film \\\"Rashomon\\\" on those stories. But compared to other short story writers and other Japanese writers, Akutagawa isn't nearly on their level.  Delving into Japanese classics had always been a goal of mine since I started reading more frequently. Akutagawa Ryunosuke was the first Japanese author I've read of with his work Life of a Stupid Man, an incredible piece of literature in my opinion. So here I am delving into his more of his works.|Instead of talking about this book in general, I will make a weekly discussion to dissect each short stories in depth on my Instagram @agathachristiebells. I will try not to be spoilery but if you have read it or maybe wanted to know more, there are amazing reviews and analysis online that talked about the stories in more details.|CW: suicide|Akutagwa Ryunosuke was known as Japanese Father of Short Stories. His sharp literary style and usage of language were never stagnant: \\\"it moves along like a living thing\\\". He published Rashomon in 1916 at the age of 23-years-old and was praised by the legendary writer Natsume Soseki. Akutagawa brilliantly crafted a story from classical works into a contemporary modernist literature that transcend generation. Unfortunately, he commited suicide at the age of 35, in which he wrote actively for only twelve years in his career. |1.Rashomon (1915)|Rash\\u014dmon in Kyoto was the grander of the two city gates built during\\u00a0the Heian period (794\\u20131185). In this story, calamity had struck the city of Kyoto caused a decline to the capital. Set in Heian Period, it is a tale of an ex-servant who in a precarious situation of being left homeless after he was fired from a job. In order to survive the night of a stormy weather, he decided to take cover in the abandoned gates filled with corpses. He then encountered an old woman suspiciously prodding around the corpses.|This was fairly short with 7 pages long of we looking at the unnamed character and his actions and decisions in the moment. There is an internal struggle of choices between surviving but with a price to pay or died alongside the corpses. There is symbolism in here that subtly present though not obvious and I found it on a reread, they are much clearer. This one was a good introduction in this book and sets the pace of the book well. |2. Hell Screen|Yoshihide was known to be the best painter but with an ugly face and not an ounce of compassion to others with an exception of his daughter. When he is tasked to create a painting of Hell Screen by Lord Horikawa, a powerful authority whom coveted his talent but despised Yoshihide's unseemingly arrogant behaviour who thinks he is above others and his disrespect towards culture and religion, Yoshihide fell into the dark abyss of hell on earth. |This story depicted artistic obsession and dilemma similarly Akutagawa was towards his writing. Yoshihide is obssesed with his art and the only emotion of love he had was for his adolescent daughter, a compassionate and mild mannered girl. Yoshihide's passion towards art border into madness as he painted from observation and gained the picture by real life depiction rather than imagination such as rotting corpses and dreams of his encounter with the Hell Wardens.|His tendencies to paint real life depictions gave the authentic feeling to his painting but he sacrificed many things in order to reach the state. His sacrilegious behaviour torturing his apprentices indicate his manic tendencies to achieve perfection even go as far as the act of a devil. This story blew my mind. Its so briliantly written with introduction to characters, the peak of insanity, unexpected and twisted climax which ends on a depressing conclusion. A well crafted story that showed human's greed and jealousy can burns the world as if hell exists even in the real life. |3. In a Bamboo Grove|A reread. I have read this short story three times and it still remains vague and ambiguous on the actual truth. |The story questioned on how our memory can be unreliable and each persons had their own subjective experiences on seeing the same things thus giving different answers to one question. |It started with the testimony of a woodcutter then a travelling priest, a policeman and an old woman on the killing of a 26-year-old Kanazawa no Takehiro who found stabbed in a bamboo grove. We then get a confession from the killer, the wife of Takehiro Masago and in the end, the spirit's confession himself through a medium. What really interest me was the fact all 3 people involved in this incident had different stories showed that they either embelish or exaggerate their stories according to their own principles. One in anger, another for honour and lastly to subdue the shamefullness because of lust. Its an interesting take on how we convey our words in order to make it look differently from others.|In the end, we don't know the absolute truth as we can only relies on the statements and confession given by the witnesses and suspect as each person gave their words according to their own advantage either to save honour or cover for others. It was left to our own interpretation.|TW: sexual assault, physical assault, animal cruelty, arson, suicide|The second section of the book titled Under the Sword comprised of 3 stories: Dr Ogata Ryosai's Memorandum, O-gin and Loyalty. |In this section, the stories mostly based during the period of rules by Tokugawa shogun. Tokugawa ruled the country with power and force in fear of any rebellion and being overthrown. This time, the fear or threat from Christianity religion which is starting to make an impact on the people, Tokugawa was afraid of this thus there are punishment and execution for those who practiced the faith. |4. Dr Ogata Ryosai's memorandum ( 1916)|Following the memorandum of Doctor Ogata, this reports on a widow named Shino who has a young daugther that fallen ill. She was a practising Kirishitan or Christian thus causing her to be abhored and pushed away from the neighbours. In desperate need for help, she seeks Dr Ogata to see her daughter's sickly state but due to her religion, the doctor refused unless she abandoned the faith. |Interestingly, this story pit religion and family together. Its a story that shows the choice between keeping your religion or choose your flesh and blood. Certainly, its a notion that is cruel but soon we will see what fate arrived to Shino as she decided on her own as she was pushed to commit an unwilling act for her daughter. In the end, there is a twist of fate and it may seems unbelievable but a miracle do occur.|5. O-gin|Opposite to the miracle in the earlier story, this one questioned the choice make by the character. O-gin is an orphan girl who lost both of her parents at young age and she was adopted by a couple who are Christian though not many people know about it. They however were caught by the Satan and brought to the magistrate for cruel punishment and forced to denounce their faith. At the time of execution, O-gin decision to back away from Christian crumbles down as she realized she can never go to Heaven and abandon her birth parents whom she believed are in the depths of Hell.|This story made me think a lot on the choice of religion and family again. Being loyal to the religion in here meaning you are abandoning your family but O-gin decided to not be selfish and instead chose her parents. Its a debate of choice and weighing the importance of these two things in life. This will make an interesting discussion.|TW: murder, decapitation, graphic violence|6. Loyalty|This is fascinating as the terms loyalty coined to the person served to a bloodline. In here, we see a head of a household, a samurai started to have fits and nervous breakdown that ultimately led him being out of boundary and potentially harming the family's name. The Elder of the House decided that the master should refrain himself from attending any events that take place in the castle in fear of him embarassing or bring disgrace to the family. The elder is more loyal to serve the house than his own master thus lead to him being almost killed but instead he left the house, no longer want to serve the family. The next elder appointed is more accustomed or acquaintard with the house master as he seen him grew up and here, he is more loyal to the master than the house itself. So you see there is a different loyalty in the same household. There is a disatrous event occured after the master decision to go to the castle for last time before he retired causing the destruction of his whole bloodline. |Around this time, Akutagawa himself seems to be having his own nervous breakdown. This story may reflected his own mental state as the main character seems to fear almost everything and lashed out whenever something ticks him. |7. The story of the head that fell off |Set in the backdrop of Sino-Japanese War where tension is rising between China and Japan, war destroyed many people. Xiao-er, a chinese man went to a fight with Japanese cavalrymen and as he clash swords with them, he felt a sword hit his neck and then he ran away atop of his horse to flee from the dire situation. He fell from the horse, on the verge of his death, his past life started to passed by him in shapes of the clouds, his mother's apron, the field of his home, the foot of a woman he loved and the festival he attended. Slowly, he startdd to regret his past actions and want to live a better life. Soon after, a newspaper stated an accident of a human head falls off after a brawl in a diner. |This story was sort of a dark comedy/humor because there is a twisted ending of the man. Regrets came too late for him despite many things. In a way, this story showed that humans somehow will always make bad decision even though they always said they will do better next time.|7/9/2021|8. Green Onions|Interestingly, in here Akutagawa breaks the fourth wall and was present in the story by saying he need to complete this story in order to meet a deadline. It gave a slight humor although as always, there is something to be taken from the story itself. |O-Kimi, a beautiful young waitress in a cafe had fallen in love with a young charming Tanaka. O-Kimi had this childlike or romantic notion of love , potraying the ideal image of Tanaka but she also knows that he could not possibly be perfect. However, when someone is in love, they tend to put a rose tinted glasses on and admire the person so much, they will look past their lacking. When both of them are on a date, Tanaka harbours an ill intent that may occur if not for O-Kimi's attention diverted to green onions on display in the street neighbourhood. What exactly is the significance?|Simple as it is, she was awaken to the reality of economic and financial situation she was in after seeing the green onions' price. She was worried about her rents, next meal payments, and obligations in her life other than romantic relationship with Tanaka. There is a potential danger when Tanaka invited O-Kimi to a house they are supposed to go but this was stopped by his sight of her with the green onions on her arms. As if all intent vanished the moment he sees her that way. |9. Horse Legs|This is fascinating. Hanzaburo suddenly passed away but turns out, this was a mistake by the grim reapers and they eventually returned him back to the living world. However, here's the problem, Hanzaburo had died three days ago, his legs had start to become rotten and in order to cover this mistake, the grim reapers replaced his legs with horse legs. Hanzaburo was devastated and in order to conceal this hideous facts, he kept his legs in boots all the time and never let other people see his legs.|Content warning: Death, suicide, attempted suicide, affairs|10. Life of a Stupid Man|\\\"I am living now in the unhappiest happiness imaginable. Yet, strangely I have no regrets\\\" |\\\"I may wear the skin of an urbane sophisticate, but in this manuscript I invite you to strip it off and laugh at my stupidity\\\" |I almost cried just by reading these words. |This was my 3rd time reading this stories. Its an autobiographical stories comprised of 51 short anthologies or rather I would call it Akutagawa's musings on his life and principles. It was published posthumously after his death by his close friend. Attached to the manuscript was his letter to him which said he is entitled to release this stories but must not identify or put a names to the people he spoke about. |Cadavers|\\\"If I needed a corpse, I'd kill someone without the slightest malice. Of course, the reply stated where it was - inside his heart\\\"|Man-made wings|\\\"At twenty nine, life no ponger held any brightness for him, but Voltaire supplied him with man made wings. |\\\"The higher he flew, the farther below him sank joyd and sorrows of a lifr bathed in the light of intellect\\\"|We started with his descriptions of his mother whom he described as lunatic and whom he barely have any affection for but also afraid he becomes like her as he lives each days with fear. Then, we moved slowly as he grow to become a writer but pressured to concur with the writing industry, married to a woman he loves but end up in affairs, growing passion for arts and philosophy but also contradict most of them, become a father but felt he is useless and unsuitable and each time he muses on death and what does it mean to live. |The Birth|\\\"Why did this one have to be born - to come into the worls like all the others, this world so full of suffering?\\\" |Comic Puppet|\\\"He wanted to live life so intensely that he could die at any moment without regrets\\\"|Stuffed Swan (this particularly hits me the hardest)|\\\"As he thought about his life, he felt both tears and mockery welling up inside him. All that lay before him was madness or suicide\\\"|I couldn't put into words or make a proper dissection on this one because its personal and raw and basically him telling his own stories in the most vulnerable state he was in, secrets being unburied, darkest desires and emotions being poured out, philosophy shared and contradicted and generally him saying he is unable to be a man worth enough to live. Its quite painful in a away but subtly conveyed in each short passages he wrote. |Interestingly enough, he wrote these using third point of view as if it was another person but it was actually him. Maybe he tries to separate the creation he wrote about from his life but he knows so well it is him and will always be him. |11. Death Register|In here, we see his life in full lights with him describing the death of his insane mother, an elder sister he barely knew, and the father who left him when he was an infant but always tried to reconcile with him somehow. Akutagawa doesnt get love from his real parents but he was given plenty by his adoptive parents. This was poetic and lyrical piece of essay he wrotes on each of his family members and ones that I felt most attached to was his recall of his father's dying on his deathbed. Such a sad moment. The story ended with a haiku as went to visit the graves of his beloved, his thoughts of them dying as if they are fortunate enough to die rather than live.|12. Dragon: The Old Potter's Tale (1919)|- Similar to The Nose, this story also points out on appearance and religion where the Buddhist monk named E'in had a giant nose and this caused him to be the centre of jokes by many. In order to divert the attention from his looks, he concoct a revenge by putting a signboard saying that a dragon will ascend to heaven on the third month. The words spread around like wildfire, even if people had doubts, majority believed the news and soon anticipate the event. Eventually, the day come and thousand of people gather to see the dragon but does this dragon even exist?|The theme of religion and physical appearance were themes that Akutagawa explored most in his work and this one spark more interest in the question of whether the prank could actually be true. Jay Rubin mentioned \\\"Dragon\\u00a0toys with the likelihood that religion is nothing more than mass hysteria, a force so powerful that even the fabricator of an object of veneration can be taken in by it.\\\"\\u00a0|The question whether the dragon does ascend remain vague as we are unsure whether it exist or the people in the midst of waiting for hours too invested in the notion of wanting and believing the dragon, conjure up the image of dragon. Its fascinating but as always the ending remain inconclusive. |13. The Spider Thread (1918)|Its a very short story but concise in conveying the message. Talked about sinner's and how one act of compassion lead to a help from the lord above but a greed will cause the downfall. Kandata, a vicious murderer was punished in the lowest of Hells but his action of letting a spider live ultimately gave him a help to climb to heaven by the spider thread. There are depiction of gruesome hell and its a terrifying scene. For someone as selfish as Kandata who won't share his help from above with others eventually lead to his eternal damnation in Hell |An interesting twist of fate is that I was surprised that an anime Erased I just finished watching had a connection with this story I read yesterday. The anime talked about this short story and it was so twisted in the mind of a person and I was pleasantly surprised by the coincidence.|It was published for children based on Taisho fairy tales|14. Spinning Gears Verdant vignettes vibrate across the reader\\u2019s eyes, as the are drawn into the splendiferous similes which dance across the page, shimmering like the pale reflection of sun-light on pebbles in a Japanese garden. Akutagawa fused he aesthetics of haiku with the psychology of Dostoevsky and other Western writers; style and form are as central to his stories as structure, psychology and characters, yet few short story writers are able to match the sheer diversity of Akutagawa\\u2019s ouvre; whether it be Gogolian fantasy in \\u2018The Nose\\u2019, discourses on the power of art in \\u2018Hell Screen\\u2019 or proto magical realism in \\u2018Horse Legs\\u2019, the breadth of Akutagawa\\u2019s stories in immense.|The highlight of these stories is undoubtedly \\u2018Hell Screen\\u2019, a macabre exploration of the darker elements of artistic inspiration, as the titular character, the morose and morbid painter Yoshide, tortures others to gain inspiration for his depiction of hell. Other highlights include, \\u2018In a Budding Grove\\u2019 which explores the nature of narrative perspective and was the inspiration for Kurosawa\\u2019s \\u2018Rashomon\\u2019 and \\u2018Spinning Gears\\u2019 a playful and poetic l pieces which reminders the reader of the jejunish experimental fiction of Oulipo. |Interspersed within the short stories are some strikingly pretty images, such as;|\\u201cPine boughs stretched across the empty sky, and in them hung a copper-coloured moon devoid or radiance.\\u201d|\\u201cA butterfly fluttered it\\u2019s wings in a wind thick with the smell of seaweed.

It was an abundant field of ripened wheat sprinkled with wild roses\\u201d) or of the aspiring artist, Yasukichi, whose cloyingly clich\\u00e9d funeral orations are held in higher regards than his art. More than this, his stories are about love and disillusions and jjoys there is something quintessentially modern the urban romance in \\u2018Green Onions\\u2019. Akutagawa is, along with Chekhov and Katherine Mansfield, one of the greatest short story writers.  I would highly recommend this edition which has introductions by Haruki Murakami and translator Jay Rubin. Additional commentary and notes by Jay Rubin help you to understand background of stories. Akutagawa basically created many of his stories from ancient Japanese fables. However His autobiographical stories rely on theme of loneliness and death. I have found this theme in all other Japanese literature which I read. If you want to read Japanese literature then I think Akutagawa's name should be at top of your list. Japan's highest litaeture award is named after Him. |I got to know Ry\\u016bnosuke Akutagawa in 2014 because of art movie Ghost Dog : Way of The Samurai. Jim Jarmusch is one of my most favourite filmmaker and I absolutely devour His movies. The film borrows a lot of elements from French movie Le Samoura\\u00ef, Seijun Suzuki's Branded to Kill.|Just like central character of Le Samoura\\u00ef, Ghost Dog lives his criminal life with Samurai code. He is seen oftenly reading Hagakure by Yamamoto Tsunetomo and shows liking to Ry\\u016bnosuke Akutagawa's rashomon and recommends it to a minor character.  The stories included in this collection reflect an author who is intelligent, well-read, perceptive and deeply aware of human foibles. Half of the short stories are very entertaining and revealing, written in the cadences of ancient Eastern folk tales. |The author wrote these stories in the book in the years 1915 to 1925, in Japan, using Chinese and Japanese literary and cultural themes. But they not only educate the reader in the themes of Eastern literature, they also demonstrate that humanity is the same whether living in the East or West, no matter what century. The way people feel about the mysteries of their lives is the same whatever the setting. At the same time, the different, distinctly Eastern cultural prism through which our commonalities present themselves reflect a Japanese view in these stories that is a bit mystifying, and very interesting. |This collection includes two very famous stories, \\u2018Rashomon\\u2019 and \\u2018In a Bamboo Grove\\u2019, which were combined together into the plot of a famous Japanese movie, which in turn Hollywood has not so aptly attempted to imitate in several variations. A character\\u2019s character in point of view is certainly shown to be important in deciding veracity of a tale! |For the record, in the story Rashomon I believe the ghost, Tekehiro, is the most truthful. I believe he incorrectly reads his wife's actions and motivations, but he was the most truthful as he understood what happened.|Tekehiro\\u2019s wife, Masago, saw in Tekehiro what she interpreted as contempt in his face after she was raped. I believe she misread her husband's emotion. She saw what she feared most. She continuously lost consciousness and was extremely stressed. She had been raped, after all. Tajomaru, the rapist, was also a braggart and a criminal. He probably did not feel he would be let go or considered innocent after his capture by authorities. He would be most interested in inflating his actions, so I don't believe him in that there was a fight between him and Tekehiro. |After raping her, Tajomaru, I think, added insult to injury and tormented Masago, only increasing her distress and her certainty that her husband would despise her. In reality (?!?), the thief only wanted to rape, torment and rob the couple. Masago would have been wild with shame and fear of rejection by her husband, as well as feeling hopeless in having been degraded. |Tekehiro would have been dishonored and shamed by his impotence, greed, dupability and perhaps his suspicion that his wife lost respect for him. This would lead him to believe she could easily want him dead for that, and thus he would be blind to how she might be hiding her own shameful acts of wanting to save her life and honor by going with the thief, whom she believed wanted to take her with him (I think that's what he whispered to her in the short story). |The thief forced her to publicize her choice of living over loyalty, so, by his trick, she shamed herself twice over by her choice of deserting her husband. When the thief revealed his trick, she was triply humiliated - first the rape, and then her choice of deserting her husband, then in being fooled and rejected. After the thief left (why would he untie the husband, realistically?) I think, unable to face her wretched self-betrayal and afraid of her husband's supposed need for revenge and rage, she did try to stab him, but perhaps incompetently. She was 19, a young girl. After she ran away, her husband killed himself in self-loathing. The girl's mom said he was kind at heart, and he was a man of honor. At least that's how it makes sense to me, given what I know of human nature.|Of course, uncertain narrators abound, so what all of us judges can go by is what we know of human nature along with the testimony. Akutagawa has made the reader one of the characters in the story, has he not? As judges, truth must be assigned as a probability instead of a certainty. Although I believe in my above synopsis as the closest truth, Tajomaru confessed. I believe he raped and robbed and played a horrible spiteful trick on the couple which doomed the marriage, but as a judge, I don't believe he dueled or killed the husband physically. Tajomaru committed soul murders on the couple, perhaps. But Tajomuro has confessed out of misplaced pride and braggedo, and I'm happy to condemn him for the murder, given no other physical evidence.|The author is so clever. Now WE know the uncertainty of determining truth of phenomena which is dependent on human interpretations of reality. I have become an unreliable narrator.|I completely disbelieve the Woodcutter. Despite appearances of being disinterested, his story does not make any sense unless you accept the complete dissonance of a young wife being more like a hardened psychopathic prostitute moments after being abducted, imprisoned, and raped, by an armed man threatening death and humiliation. |Later stories included in the book, from 1925 to 1927 are more autobiographical or personal, and while revealing how similar that people feel about fear, stress, anxiety, and how we live within communal society, sadly, these somewhat autobiographical stories show how the author is losing his equilibrium and peace of mind. It is difficult to parse out if it is the fear of going insane or if it is actual instability precipitating the author\\u2019s emotional frailty. When I read my first Murakami, a compilation of short stories called \\\"After the Quake,\\\" I was amazed by his refreshing originality. Some of his stories, indeed, had the effect of an earthquake to me. There were jolting, sudden and unexpected turns. In one, a man and a woman, after a brief introduction, make love. Then, out of nowhere, the man felt a sudden impulse to kill her. In another story, the characters were on a beach. Tears suddenly flow down from the eyes of one character, then they talk of killing themselves. Developments like these come without warning as they were not even hinted in the previous narration.|Now, it can be told. This style of storytelling is not at all original. Murakami, I think, copied it from this great Japanese writer who killed himself in 1927 at the age of 35--Ryunosuke Akutagawa (in the list of the 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die he's under letter \\\"R\\\"--a mistake, because his surname is Akutagawa, not Ryunosuke). By his own confession, Murakami has been reading Akutagawa since he was a teenager.|I bet that if one includes Rashomon in that compilation \\\"After the Quake\\\" an uninitiated reader will not find any difference between it and the rest of the stories there except that the latter have modern settings while \\\"Rashomon\\\" is set in 12th century Japan.|\\\"Rashomon\\\" (\\\"Mon\\\" being the Japanese for gate) was an outer castle gate, specifically the great southern main entrance to Kyoto during the Heian Period. It had massive pillars, towering archways and several chambers. The whole city of Kyoto, at the time of the story, was under civil unrest. People were hungry, even the Rashomon itself had become dilapidated for lack of proper maintenance. In the upper chamber thereof was dumped the city's dead, the victims of the prevailing hunger and violence.|In the lower chamber sits a servant who had just lost his job. He is said to be waiting for the rain to stop but he knows that even if the rain stops he really has nowhere to go and nothing to do. He had come to the dreadful conclusion that he would either die of starvation or survive by being a thief.|The mood is somber, the descriptive prose is elegant, fluid and spontaneous. Just like Murakami (in his short stories). Then the servant sees something...Thereafter comes one event after another which felt like Murakami's earthquakes, with a similar ending that leaves unanswered questions.|In the Introduction to the life and works of Akutagawa a Japanese literary critic, in 1917, described him (Akutagawa) as \\\"a writer who can't write without props.\\\" I was amused by this because elsewhere in goodreads before, discussing Kafka on the Shore with a Murakami fanatic K.D., I wrote that Murakami had used a lot of juvenile, ineffective props here (like talking cats, mother and son fucking, eels falling down from the sky, etc.) which were not even original as you can see parallels from Greek mythology and even in works of Lewis Carroll. |The Introduction also declared:|\\\"Sheer technique...though skillfully applied, does not necessarily translate into original literature. A fictional world that was not truly (the author's) own and that used borrowed containers would eventually reach and impasse and come to stand in his way like a high wall. Further pursuit of fictional method could only yield technical polish. And not surprisingly, the novelty would wear thin and readers would tire of seeing the same devices.\\\"|Wow, I myself could have said this after reading Kafka on the Shore! Now, guess who wrote this introduction? Close your eyes and bang your head on the wall--Haruki Murakami himself.|LOL! In his (undated ... perhaps 2006?) introduction, Haruki Murakami gives us what he thinks would be Japan's 10 most important \\\"writers of national stature\\\". They are writers that \\\"left us works of the first rank that vividly reflect the mentality of the Japanese people ... [the works] must have the power to survive at least a quarter century after the writer's death. ... The important thing is whether each of them as an individual human being embraced an awareness of the great questions of the age, accepted his or her social responsibility as an artist on the front line, and made an honest effort to shape his or her life accordingly.\\\"|Haruki believes the top 10 to be:|#1. |S\\u014dseki Natsume|. Equal #2 are: 2.|Akutagawa Ry\\u016bnosuke|, 2.|\\u014cgai Mori|, 4.|Shimazaki To son|, 5.|Shiga Naoya|, 6.|Jun'ichir\\u014d Tanizaki|, 7.|Yasunari Kawabata|. Equal #8 are: 8.|Osamu Dazai|, 8.|Yukio Mishima|.|He can't think of a tenth name for the list(!). Which is cute if you are a fan of |Kenzabur\\u014d \\u014ce|. Haruki is such a bitch. He goes on to say that \\\"Kawabata's works, to be honest, have always been a problem for me. ... I have never been able to identify very closely with his fictional world.\\\" And \\\"With reagrd to Shimazaki and Shiga, I can only say that I have no particular interest in them ... what I have read has left little trace in my memory.\\\"|So old Kenzaburo has been excluded from Haruki's list of 10 ... which only includes 9 ... and of which, 3 he really doesn't have time for? Ouch.|But Haruki's obviously mad. He seems to say that |Botchan| can be \\\"memorized whole by most school children\\\". What?|On to Akutagawa ... I liked the \\\"I\\\" stuff the best. [3.25 stars]|Akutagawa's short stories are so engaging, and his use of words is very thoughtful. Some of them are very humorous, and the others havs poignant social messages. |Haruki Murakami, who wrote an introduction for this book, says, |\\\"The flow of his language is the best feature of Akutagawa's style. Never stagnant, it moves along like a living thing. His choice of words is intuitive, natural-and beautiful.\\\"|The titular story, Rash\\u014dmon, is an exquisite work which shows how morality could be at odds with the need for survival. It is very profound. |Other stories which I liked include:|\\u2022\\\"The Bamboo Grove\\\" (which I'd read and reviewed separately much earlier)|\\u2022\\\"The Nose\\\", a satire on public perception of one's appearance |\\u2022\\\"The Hell Screen\\\", a shocking story about a painter who goes insane in the process of finishing his magnum opus (a piece showcasing what hell would be like) and allows his innocent daughter to be set on flames in order to further the realistic nature of his art. |\\\"I could have sworn that the man's eyes were no longer watching his daughter dying in agony, that instead the gorgeous colors of flames and the sight of a woman suffering in them were giving him joy beyond measure.\\\"|\\u2022\\\"Dr. Ogata Ry\\u014dsai: Memorandum\\\" and \\\"O-Gin\\\" showed the early days of Christianity in Japan, and how followers of that sect were at odds with the other people around them and with the hostile government, as their faith is challenged at every turn. These were very interesting to read. |\\u2022\\\"The Story of a Head That Fell Off\\\" is a Chinese story depicting the horrors of war, and the people who fight those wars. |\\\"Xiao-er was overcome by a mysterious loneliness such as he had never experienced before. The vast blue sky hung above him in silence. People had no choice but to go on living their pitiful lives beneath that sky, buffeted by the winds that blow down from above. What loneliness! And how strange, he thought, that he had never known this loneliness until now.\\\"|\\u2022\\\"Horse Legs\\\" is arguably the most humorous story in this collection. It has a sardonic and tongue-in-cheek tone throughout. A newspaper article that comes out after the protagonist goes mad and runs away from home states, |\\\" What we would like to ask, however, is not \\\"What is the name of Mr. Oshino's malady?\\\" but rather \\\"What is Mr. Oshino's responsibility to his wife?\\\" Like an unblemished golden jar, our glorious National Essence stands upon a foundation of belief in the family. We need not ask, then, how grave the responsibilities of the head of any one family might be. Does the head of a family have the right to go mad any time he feels like it? To this question we must offer a resounding \\\"No!\\\" |Imagine what would happen if the husbands of the world suddenly acquired the right to go mad. All, without exception, would leave their families behind for a happy life of song on the road, or wandering over hill and dale, or being kept well fed and clothed in an insane asylum. Then our 1,000-year-old belief in the family \\u2014 our very pride in the eyes of the world \\u2014 could not fail to collapse. We are not, of course, urging that Mr. Oshino be treated harshly. We must, however, loudly beat the drum to condemn his rash crime of having gone mad. No, let this not be limited to Mr. Oshino's crime alone. We must also condemn the utter misfeasance of successive administrations for having neglected our urgent need for a law prohibiting insanity.\\\"|I did not enjoy the supposed autobiographical section called \\\"Akutagawa's Own Story\\\" as much as I did his fiction. They had their moments, but were overall quite tedious to read.|Daidoji Shinsuke explores his childhood and school, with the narrator being a self-proclaimed intellectual. \\\"Death Register\\\" talks about his estranged, insane mother, an elder sister he never got to know, and his father who relinquished him as a baby. \\\"The Life of a Stupid Man,\\\" and \\\"Spinning Gears\\\" both show Akutagawa probing the meaning of the life he has led to that point, and moving ever closer to death. |* |Notes for myself|\\u2022 |Akutagawa's mental illnesses and their impact on his work|\\\"We will never know for certain whether the neuroses from which he suffered later in life were caused by hereditary factors, mental instability, or his latent fears, but sickness of mind casts a heavy shadow on the late stories and would end up taking his life. Surely it would be no exaggeration to say that writing these late works effectively shortened his life, but it is also true that he was unable to find a way to go on living as a writer without writing works of this nature-and once he could no longer live as a writer, his life would cease to have meaning. It well could be that Akutagawa had to turn to the world of storytelling and technique in order to find refuge from his dark heredity. Rather than face the real world, so full of terror and pain, he might have transported himself mind and body into another world in hopes of finding a kind of salvation in its fictionality.\\\"|\\u2022|Akutagawa's position in Japanese literary history, as given by Murakami| \\\"Perhaps the true reason that Akutagawa Ryunosuke continues to be read and admired today as a \\\"national writer\\\" lies in this in the realization and determination that effectively pushed him into a dead end. He started out as one of the chosen few: a Japanese intellectual with a consciousness torn between the West and Japan's traditional culture, in the border regions of which he succeeded in erecting a uniquely vigorous world of story. As he matured, he attempted to fuse the two different cultures inside himself at a higher level. He attempted structurally to combine the distinctively Japanese style of the I-novel with his own elegant fictional method. He hoped, in other words, to pioneer a newer, more uniquely Japanese form of serious literature. But this would have required a strenuous, long-term effort that his hypersensitive nerves and delicate con- stitution could not sustain. Pursued by the dark visions that crawled out of the gloom, he would finally despair and cut his life short. Akutagawa's terrible suicide administered a great shock to the minds of his contemporaries. It signaled both the defeat of a member of the intellectual elite and a major turning point in history.|Many Japanese would see in the death of this one writer the triumph, the aestheticism, the anguish, and the unavoidable downfall of the Taish\\u014d Period's cultivated elite. His individual declaration of defeat also became a signpost on the road of history leading to the tragedy of the Second World War. In the period just before and after his death, the flower of democracy that had bloomed with such promise in the Taisho Period simply shriveled and died. Soon the boots of the military would resound everywhere. The writer Akutagawa Ryunosuke stands as an illuminating presence in the history of Japanese literature, a symbol of his age's brief glory and quiet defeat.\\\"|\\u2022|The role of a writer in the contemporary globalized world|\\\"Today, when the world is growing ever smaller through the spectacular development of the Internet and the increasingly rapid flow of economic interchange, we find ourselves in a pressing situation whereby, like it or not, our very survival depends on our ability to exchange cultural methodologies on an equivalent basis. To turn toward a stance of national exclusivity, regionalism, or fundamentalism in which nations become isolated politically, economically, culturally, or religiously could bring about unimaginable dangers on a worldwide scale. If only in that sense, we novelists and other creative individuals must simultaneously broadcast our cultural messages outward and be flexible receptors of what comes to us from abroad. Even as we unwaveringly preserve our own identity, we must exchange that which can be exchanged and understand that which can be mutually understood. Our role is perfectly clear.\\\" It\\u2019s hard to review something like Ry\\u016bnosuke Akutagawa\\u2019s | Rash\\u014dmon and Seventeen Other Stories|: it\\u2019s too complex, too often inducing a |\\u201cWhat was that I read?\\u201d|, too deep, and yet approachable, very readable. |I found this book by chance while surfing Goodreads, and was immediately attracted by | Rash\\u014dmon|, since I am a fan of Kurosawa\\u2019s, and am all admiration for that particular film (the plot of which, ironically, draws more from Akutagawa\\u2019s |In the Bamboo Grove| than it does from | Rash\\u014dmon| itself). I bought the book and told myself that I\\u2019d read it slowly, one short story at a time\\u2014and found myself caught like a fly in a spider\\u2019s web. I ended up reading most of this book in long stretches, until my eyes hurt. |The eighteen stories are very diverse in nature: there are ghosts here, and dragons. There is hell, both somewhat distant, seen through the benevolent eyes of the Sakyamuni in |The Spider Thread|, |and| close, horrifying, macabre\\u2014as in |Hell Screen|. There are tales of a Japan torn between tradition and modernity, of battles between Christianity and older, local beliefs. There are battles, too, between man and man, and\\u2014most forcibly, most searingly, the stories of man\\u2019s battles with himself. The latter are brought most vividly (and disturbingly) to life in the last section of the book, which brings together six autobiographical stories by Akutagawa. |As I progressed through this book, I went through a range of emotions. I laughed at the quirky humour in |The Nose, Dragon: The Old Potter\\u2019s Tale| and |Green Onions|. I shivered at the cruelty of |Hell Screen|. And I couldn\\u2019t help but wonder how much of |Spinning Gears| (which was published posthumously, after Akutagawa killed himself in 1927) was real, and how much was not. |This is a brilliant book. It\\u2019s rich, textured, detailed. The imagery is often breathtaking (\\u201c|She had a radiant face, like the morning sun on a thin sheet of ice\\u201d|), and the layers are fascinating, peeling away from the mundane, even comical, to the wryly profound. As an example: |\\u201dHe put a cigarette in his mouth and was striking a match when he collapsed face-down on his desk and died. It was a truly disappointing way to die.

In addition, there\\u2019s a brief but good biography of Akutagawa, and a superb introduction by Haruki Murakami. I would advise reading all of these, besides the stories that comprise the book: they help get a better insight into the author, and so add to the experience. |I ended this book feeling both oddly deflated |and| inspired. As a writer, I can\\u2019t help but be inspired by writing of such stature. As a writer, too, I can\\u2019t help but feel that I cannot possibly ever write as brilliantly as this. Not a book I am going to forget in a hurry, if ever.  I first came by Ry\\u016bnosuke Akutagawa via Akira Kurosawa\\u2019s 1950 film |Rash\\u014dmon|. It\\u2019s an adaptation of two short stories within this collection: \\u201cIn a Bamboo Grove\\u201d and \\u201cRash\\u014dmon\\u201d (though Kurosawa adapted the former and simply took the name of the latter and used it as a framing device). It\\u2019s one of my favorite Kurosawa films, and so I knew I\\u2019d like to check out the source material at some point. I\\u2019m glad I did, because there are some really good stories here and it\\u2019s an overall well-rounded anthology.|This collection is divided into four sections: A World in Decay, Under the Sword, Modern Tragicomedy, and Akutagawa's Own Story. Akutagawa crosses genres throughout these stories--from comedy to drama to autobiography to Jidaigeki to the Gothic--and a lot of them work out quite well. I\\u2019m a particular fan of \\u201cIn a Bamboo Grove,\\u201d \\u201cHell Screen,\\u201d \\u201cThe Nose,\\u201d \\u201cThe Spider Thread,\\u201d and \\u201cGreen Onions.\\u201d The autobiographical stories in the last section, while at times quite fascinating in learning about Akutagawa\\u2019s inner turmoil, don\\u2019t read as well as the previous stories; they\\u2019re interesting and informational, but they\\u2019re ultimately a little hard to get into and not as entertaining as the previous stories.|Akutagawa is a great writer. He oftentimes has some slick and inviting prose, which makes for easy and enjoyable reading. His well-placed comedic touches were surprising too. However, if you aren\\u2019t that educated on Japanese history and geography, like me, then you may struggle a bit with the references. There are extremely helpful note indications throughout, but that means flipping to the back of the book, which does disrupt the flow of reading. I\\u2019d definitely recommend this collection, but some might want to proceed with caution. This collection of short stories had no discernable connection or theme throughout. The stories were pretty different: some were fantastical/fairytale-like, with spirits and gods etc.; others were realistic historical fiction. The realistic ones were also pretty varied: some featured real historical figures, like poets, artists and politicians; others were populated by completely fictional characters. Some were set in ancient times, some in medieval, some in XVII, XVIII, XIX centuries. |Jumping between these entirely different tones and settings felt jarring|.|There were a |few stories I thought were brilliant|, moving or enjoyable. One of them, in particular, was about |Matsuo Bash\\u014d|, made me want to pick up a collection of his haikus. |But for at least a |half of the book or more, I was bored and struggled| through unknown words, things and concepts, spirits and historical figures which carried no meaning for me, character/plot arcs that I didn't get.\",\n          \"I had a predisposition to like this, as I enjoy Sir Walter Scott, and I also read and enjoyed Maturin's \\\"Melmoth the Wanderer\\\" some years ago. In fact, this was such enjoyable escapism that I think I got more pleasure from it than any other book I've read this year so far. It helps that I have always felt more at home in the 13th century than the 21st. This is a magnificent blend of Gothic fantasy: battles, jousts, sieges, damsels in distress, wise hermits, evil witches, corrupt ecclesiastics - even werewolves...with plenty of comedy to leaven the horror, and some bromance to leaven the courtly love of knights for maidens. Some of the physical description, such as of the bandit castle by the sea, left me vertiginously intoxicated. I was there, torchlight flickering as I climbed the stone spiral staircase, damp exhalations from the dungeons beneath, looking out over the battlements on a wild and stormy sea under the star crossed sky...|Are there faults? Only if you dislike this sort of thing. If you know nothing of the historical background, are not familiar with the Bible, and have no Latin, then it would be very confusing. One of the comic themes is the relationship between two worldly prelates, the battle-axe-wielding Bishop of Toulouse and the wine-bibbing Abbot of Normoutier. The bishop's disdain for the latter is founded on the Abbot's frequent mangling of his Latin quips and descent into \\\"dog\\\" Latin. I think I missed a lot of the wittier and more abstruse puns, but then as a schoolboy my Latin compositions were often disfigured by my Latin master drawing a lamppost in the margin of my exercise book, signifying that my efforts were mere \\\"dog\\\" Latin themselves. |Nevertheless this is a tightly plotted page-turner and I was sorry when it came to an end. I read the four volume edition available for free download on the Bodleian Library site, and my most annoying moment was the discovery that one page was missing. But that still left more than 1,400 others - and not a page too long.| Maturin, as an Irish Anglican priest, experienced bigotry and sectarianism at first hand. The ending is conventional in that we get happy marriages all round, but perhaps not so conventional in that the context is one of happy ecumenism and the healing of apparently irreconcilable religious difference through the solvent of love and friendship. In a world still marred by the effects of religiously inspired intolerance, this book is not as far from contemporary concerns as it may at first appear.
